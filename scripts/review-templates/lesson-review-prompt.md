- **Module:** {{MODULE_TITLE}}
- **Lesson:** {{LESSON_TITLE}} (ID: {{LESSON_ID}})
- **Difficulty:** {{DIFFICULTY}}
- **Estimated Time:** {{ESTIMATED_MINUTES}} minutes

## Current Lesson Content

{{LESSON_CONTENT_JSON}}

## Review Instructions

Perform the following analysis:

### 1. Accuracy Check
- Verify all code examples are syntactically correct
- Confirm technical explanations match current {{COURSE_LANGUAGE}} documentation
- Search the web for the latest {{COURSE_LANGUAGE}} version and verify examples work with it
- Flag any deprecated APIs, syntax, or patterns

### 2. Completeness Check
- Does the lesson cover all concepts needed for a beginner to understand this topic?
- Are there missing explanations between concepts that would confuse a learner?
- Does the lesson have:
  - [ ] A clear analogy or real-world example (ANALOGY section)
  - [ ] Theoretical explanation (THEORY section)
  - [ ] Working code example (EXAMPLE section)
  - [ ] Common mistakes to avoid (WARNING section)
  - [ ] At least one practice challenge

### 3. Freshness Check
- Search for "{{COURSE_LANGUAGE}} {{LESSON_TITLE}} 2024 2025" to find latest practices
- Compare lesson content against current best practices
- Identify any outdated patterns or recommendations

### 4. Pedagogical Gap Analysis
- What prerequisite knowledge is assumed but not explained?
- What follow-up questions would a learner likely have?
- What practical applications or use cases are missing?
- Are the challenges appropriately scaffolded for the difficulty level?
