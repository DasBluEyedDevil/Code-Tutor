## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Content normalization must complete before any course audit begins
- [Roadmap]: Course audit order: Java -> JS -> C# -> Flutter -> Kotlin -> Python (least to most structural work)
- [Roadmap]: AI tutor enhancement deferred until all 6 courses are stable (RAG on unstable content = rework)
- [01-01]: *.bak rule placed in .gitignore Backup files section (line 79) alongside *.backup.json and *.backup
- [01-01]: INFR-02 confirmed resolved: no compiled binaries ever existed in git history

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Java IO.println vs System.out.println decision needed in Phase 2 (affects 75+ files)
- Dart Frog community transition (July 2025) needs API verification in Phase 5
- ONNX Runtime GenAI 12 versions behind (0.5.2 -> current) -- upgrade risk in Phase 8
