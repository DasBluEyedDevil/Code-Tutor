<objective>
Accuracy pass across Modules 17-21 (35 lessons, ~205 content files): fix TypeScript 7.0 misinformation, verify ES2025 features and decorator status, handle Bun-specific challenges in Modules 19-20, verify both capstone projects for completeness and deployability. This is the most complex accuracy pass due to the capstone modules.

Purpose: Modules 17-21 are the advanced and capstone modules that prove a student can build and deploy real applications. The TS 7.0 misinformation is factually wrong and must be fixed. Bun-specific challenges that cannot execute in the app need a clear strategy. Both capstones must have complete, actionable deployment instructions.

Output: Corrected content across 5 modules with TS 7.0 fixed, ES2025 verified, Bun challenges handled, and capstones verified.

  </files>
  <action>
    Read every content file in Modules 17-19 (17 lessons). Verify:

    **1. Module 17 -- JSDoc (CRITICAL TS 7.0 fix):**
    - **FIX TypeScript 7.0 misinformation:** The file `content/courses/javascript/modules/17-type-safe-javascript-jsdoc/lessons/04-type-checking-with-bun-ts-check/content/05-warning.md` claims "TypeScript 7.0 (December 2025) changes JSDoc handling" with specific claims about removed tags (@enum, @constructor). This is FALSE. TypeScript 7.0 is NOT released. It is targeting mid-2026 and is a Go-based rewrite. The current stable TypeScript is 5.7.x.

      Replace the entire content of this WARNING section with accurate information:
      - TypeScript 7.0 is under development (Go-based rewrite, targeting mid-2026)
      - The claimed changes (@enum removal, @constructor removal) are speculative
      - Current TypeScript 5.x fully supports JSDoc type checking
      - Students should monitor TypeScript release notes for future JSDoc changes

    - Verify all other JSDoc type annotation examples are accurate (@type, @param, @returns, @typedef, @template, @satisfies)
    - Verify `tsc --checkJs` and `bun --bun ts-check` commands are real and current

    **2. Module 18 -- ES2025 Modern Patterns:**
    - **Promise.try()** -- Verify: finalized in ES2025, available in Node.js 22. If described as "proposal," update to "finalized."
    - **Iterator Helpers** (.filter, .map, .take, .drop, .forEach, .some, .every, .find, .reduce, .flatMap, .toArray) -- Verify: finalized in ES2025, available in Node.js 22 via V8 12.x. Confirm the full API surface.
    - **Set Methods** (if repeated from M05) -- Verify consistency with Module 05 content
    - **RegExp.escape()** -- Verify: finalized in ES2025
    - **Decorators** -- Module 18 Lesson 05 titled "Decorators Preview Stage 3":
      - Decorators ARE Stage 3 (since 2022)
      - They are NOT natively supported in any browser or Node.js as of Feb 2026
      - They work via TypeScript (with `experimentalDecorators` or the new standard decorators) and Babel
      - Verify the lesson accurately reflects this status. If it implies native browser support, correct it.
      - If the lesson title says "Preview," that is accurate

    **3. Module 19 -- Advanced Bun Features (Bun-specific challenge strategy):**
    - Verify content accuracy against Bun 1.3.x:
      - `bun:sqlite` -- verify Database class API, prepare/query/run methods
      - `Bun.password` -- verify hash() and verify() API
      - `Bun.$` shell -- verify template literal shell syntax
      - `Bun.build()` -- verify bundler API
      - `bun:ffi` -- verify FFI API (dlopen, CString, ptr)

    - **Challenge strategy for Bun-only APIs:**
      These 5 challenges use real Bun APIs that CANNOT run in Node.js:
      - Lesson 01 (bun:sqlite): `import { Database } from 'bun:sqlite'`
      - Lesson 02 (Bun.password): `Bun.password.hash()`, `Bun.password.verify()`
      - Lesson 04 (Bun.build): `Bun.build()`
      - Lesson 05 (bun:ffi): `import { dlopen } from 'bun:ffi'`
      - Lesson 03 (Bun.$): `Bun.$` shell

      For each challenge, apply this strategy (prioritize in order):
      a. **Simulate with Node.js equivalents** where possible:
         - bun:sqlite -> use `better-sqlite3` patterns OR simulate with in-memory object
         - Bun.password -> simulate with a simple hash function (bcrypt-like interface)
         - Bun.build -> simulate with a mock build configuration object
      b. **Mark as conceptual** where simulation is impractical:
         - bun:ffi -> Add a comment header: `// NOTE: This challenge requires Bun runtime to execute. It demonstrates Bun's FFI capabilities.`
         - Bun.$ shell -> May be simulatable with child_process.exec pattern
      c. **Add simulation wrappers** following Module 16's established pattern (describe/it/expect at top of file)
      d. For each modified challenge, ensure the educational goal is preserved -- the student should still learn the concept even if the exact API is simulated

    **4. Fix any inaccuracies.**

    Read every content file in Modules 20-21 (18 lessons, ~106 code.md/concept.md now renamed to example.md/theory.md). Verify:

    **1. Module 20 -- Capstone Task Manager API:**
    - **Project architecture:** Verify the Bun + Hono + Prisma stack is consistently described
    - **Authentication:** Check JWT implementation. Apply same Hono JWT `alg` fix as Module 11:
      - Search for `jwt(` in all content files
      - Add `alg: 'HS256'` parameter where missing
    - **CRUD endpoints:** Verify Hono routing patterns match Module 11 teachings
    - **Validation:** Verify Zod patterns match Module 11 teachings
    - **Docker configuration (CRITICAL):** Research found multiple `oven/bun:1.1` references in Module 20 Lesson 07. Update ALL to `oven/bun:1`:
      - `lessons/07-docker-configuration/content/02-code.md` (now 02-example.md after rename)
      - `lessons/07-docker-configuration/content/07-warning.md`
    - **Deployment:** Verify deployment instructions are complete and actionable (what platform? what commands?)
    - **Challenge compatibility:** Module 20 has 2 challenges using Bun APIs per research. Check each:
      - If they use bun:test imports, add simulation wrappers
      - If they use other Bun APIs, apply same strategy as Module 19

    **2. Module 21 -- Capstone React Full-Stack:**
    - **Monorepo setup:** Verify Bun workspace configuration is accurate for Bun 1.3.x
    - **Shared types:** Verify the pattern for sharing TypeScript types between frontend and backend
    - **API client:** Verify fetch() patterns with proper typing
    - **React components:** Verify functional component patterns, hooks usage, state management
    - **Authentication UI:** Verify login/register flow matches the API authentication from Module 20
    - **Protected routes:** Verify react-router-dom v6+ protected route pattern
    - **Forms and validation:** Verify form handling patterns
    - **Testing:** If React testing is covered, verify testing library usage (React Testing Library, not Enzyme)
    - **Production build and deploy:** Verify the final deployment lesson has complete, step-by-step instructions that a student could follow to deploy their project

    **3. Capstone completeness check:**
    - Does Module 20 result in a fully deployable API? Check for:
      - Database setup instructions
      - Environment variable configuration
      - Build command
      - Start command
      - Deployment platform instructions
    - Does Module 21 result in a fully deployable full-stack app? Check for:
      - Frontend build process
      - Backend + frontend integration
      - Production deployment steps
      - Both deployed (or instructions to deploy both)

    **4. Fix any inaccuracies.**

    - `grep -r "oven/bun:1.1" content/courses/javascript/modules/20-* content/courses/javascript/modules/21-* | wc -l` returns 0

    - Module 20 has complete deployment instructions (not just "deploy to your platform")
    - Module 21 has complete production build + deploy instructions
    - No Bun-only imports without simulation wrappers in challenge files
  </verify>
  <done>Both capstones verified. Authentication uses JWT with alg parameter. Docker images updated. Deployment instructions complete. Challenge compatibility ensured for Node.js execution.</done>
