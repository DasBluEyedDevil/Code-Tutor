<objective>
Rename all 143 non-standard content filenames in the JavaScript course to match their frontmatter types (code.md -> example.md, concept.md -> theory.md, pitfalls.md -> warning.md), update the version manifest with verified framework versions, fix course.json metadata, and delete the refactor_course.py artifact.

Purpose: Filename consistency is a prerequisite for all subsequent plans -- auditors searching for "example" sections should find files named example.md. Version targets must be verified before accuracy passes begin. This plan must complete before any content editing starts.

Output: 143 renamed files, updated version-manifest.json, updated course.json, deleted artifact.

  <name>Task 1: Batch rename non-standard content filenames</name>
  <files>
    content/courses/javascript/modules/**/content/*-code.md (109 files -> *-example.md)
    content/courses/javascript/modules/**/content/*-concept.md (33 files -> *-theory.md)
    content/courses/javascript/modules/**/content/*-pitfalls.md (1 file -> *-warning.md)
  </files>
  <action>
    Write a script (or use a shell loop) to batch rename all non-standard content filenames using `git mv`:

    **Rename rules:**
    - `*-code.md` -> `*-example.md` (109 files, frontmatter already says type: "EXAMPLE")
    - `*-concept.md` -> `*-theory.md` (33 files, frontmatter already says type: "THEORY")
    - `*-pitfalls.md` -> `*-warning.md` (1 file, frontmatter already says type: "WARNING")

    **Distribution by module (for verification):**
    - Module 08: 6 code.md, 1 concept.md, 1 pitfalls.md = 8 renames
    - Module 10: 7 code.md, 1 concept.md = 8 renames
    - Module 11: 9 code.md, 2 concept.md = 11 renames
    - Module 16: 8 code.md, 2 concept.md = 10 renames
    - Module 20: 44 code.md, 8 concept.md = 52 renames
    - Module 21: 35 code.md, 19 concept.md = 54 renames
    Total: 109 + 33 + 1 = 143 renames

    **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT change the frontmatter inside the files. Only the filenames change. The frontmatter type values were already migrated correctly by Phase 1 (01-03).

    **Approach:** Use a bash loop:
    ```
    find content/courses/javascript -name '*-code.md' -exec sh -c 'git mv "$1" "$(echo "$1" | sed "s/-code\.md$/-example.md/")"' _ {} \;
    find content/courses/javascript -name '*-concept.md' -exec sh -c 'git mv "$1" "$(echo "$1" | sed "s/-concept\.md$/-theory.md/")"' _ {} \;
    find content/courses/javascript -name '*-pitfalls.md' -exec sh -c 'git mv "$1" "$(echo "$1" | sed "s/-pitfalls\.md$/-warning.md/")"' _ {} \;
    ```

    Also delete the leftover artifact:
    ```
    git rm content/courses/javascript/refactor_course.py
    ```

  </files>
  <action>
    **1. Update version-manifest.json JavaScript section:**
    - Update all `lastVerified` dates to today's date for JavaScript framework entries
    - Add a note to Prisma entry: "Prisma 7.0 released (ESM-first, no Rust engines); course stays on 6.x patterns. Upgrade when ecosystem stabilizes."
    - Update Bun notes to: "Alternative runtime and package manager. Course verified against Bun 1.3.x. Bun-specific APIs (bun:sqlite, bun:ffi) in Modules 19-20."
    - Update Hono notes to: "Lightweight web framework. alg option required in jwt() middleware since 4.11.0."
    - Update React notes to: "Frontend UI library. Course uses React 19 patterns (hooks, functional components)."

    **2. Update course.json:**
    - Change description from "95 interactive lessons" to "132 lessons across 21 modules" (current actual count)
    - Keep minimumRuntimeVersion as "Node.js 22" (correct)
    - Update description to accurately describe scope: "Master JavaScript from basics to full-stack with TypeScript, React, and Bun/Hono. 132 lessons across 21 modules with hands-on challenges. Updated for ES2025, Node.js 22, and Bun."

    - `node -e "const c=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('content/courses/javascript/course.json','utf8')); console.log(c.description)"` includes "132"

After both tasks complete:
1. Zero non-standard filenames in entire JS course (code.md, concept.md, pitfalls.md)
2. Version manifest updated with current verification dates and framework notes
3. course.json metadata is accurate
4. refactor_course.py artifact deleted
5. All git operations clean (no untracked files, renames preserved)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- JSCR-05 FULLY satisfied: All non-standard content types migrated (filenames now match frontmatter types)
- Version foundation established for all subsequent Phase 3 plans
- Course metadata accurate for lesson/module counts
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-javascript-course-audit/03-01-SUMMARY.md`

The SUMMARY must include:
- Count of files renamed per module
- Version manifest changes made
- course.json changes made
- Confirmation that zero non-standard filenames remain
</output>
