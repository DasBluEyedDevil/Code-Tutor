<objective>
Final verification pass across the entire JavaScript course: confirm zero remaining stale Docker images, zero TS 7.0 misinformation, all challenge files are syntactically valid and Node.js compatible, all JSON files parse correctly, and voice/progression are consistent from Module 1 through Module 21. Fix any stragglers found. Human verification checkpoint at the end.

Purpose: Plans 03-01 through 03-06 each addressed specific modules and concerns. This plan performs a global sweep to catch anything missed, verify cross-module consistency, validate all challenge files, and ensure the voice is uniform across all 132 lessons. This is the quality gate before Phase 3 is marked complete.

Output: A verified JavaScript course with zero known issues. Final checkpoint for human review.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Global search-and-fix for remaining issues</name>
  <files>
    content/courses/javascript/ (entire course tree)
  </files>
  <action>
    Run comprehensive searches across the ENTIRE JavaScript course directory and fix any remaining issues.

    **Search 1: Stale Docker images**
    ```
    grep -r "oven/bun:1.1" content/courses/javascript/
    ```
    Expected: 0 results. If any found: update to oven/bun:1 or oven/bun:1-slim.

    **Search 2: TypeScript 7.0 misinformation**
    ```
    grep -ri "TypeScript 7.0" content/courses/javascript/
    grep -ri "TypeScript 7" content/courses/javascript/
    ```
    Expected: 0 results claiming TS 7 is released. References to TS 7 as "under development" or "upcoming" are acceptable.

    **Search 3: Non-standard filenames (should be zero after 03-01)**
    ```
    find content/courses/javascript -name '*-code.md' -o -name '*-concept.md' -o -name '*-pitfalls.md'
    ```
    Expected: 0 results.

    **Search 4: Bun-only imports in challenge files**
    ```
    grep -rn "from 'bun:" content/courses/javascript/modules/*/lessons/*/challenges/
    grep -rn "from \"bun:" content/courses/javascript/modules/*/lessons/*/challenges/
    ```
    Review results: Module 19 challenges marked as "Bun-only" are acceptable. All others should have simulation wrappers.

    **Search 5: All challenge.json files are valid JSON**
    For every challenge.json under content/courses/javascript/:
    - Parse with `node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('path','utf8'))"`
    - Report and fix any invalid JSON

    **Search 6: All lesson.json files are valid JSON**
    Same validation for lesson.json files.

    **Search 7: Stale version references**
    ```
    grep -ri "Node.js 20\|Node.js 18\|Node 20\|Node 18" content/courses/javascript/
    grep -ri "React 18\b" content/courses/javascript/
    grep -ri "Prisma 5\b" content/courses/javascript/
    ```
    Fix any stale version references (course targets Node 22, React 19, Prisma 6.x).

    **Search 8: Phantom artifacts**
    ```
    find content/courses/javascript -name "*.py" -o -name "*.pyc" -o -name "*.bak"
    ```
    Delete any remaining artifacts (refactor_course.py should already be gone from 03-01).

    **Fix all issues found.** Document every fix in the commit message.

  <name>Task 2: Voice consistency and progression review</name>
  <files>
    content/courses/javascript/ (read-only scan of all modules)
  </files>
  <action>
    Read the FIRST content file (usually 01-theory.md or 01-analogy.md) of every lesson across all 21 modules (132 lessons). Check for:

    **Voice consistency:**
    - Every lesson should use a friendly mentor tone (warm, encouraging, uses analogies where present)
    - Look for sudden shifts: overly formal/academic sections, condescending tone, or dry reference-manual style
    - Flag any lessons where the voice is noticeably different from the rest
    - Pay special attention to Module 20-21 capstone lessons (which had all code.md/concept.md filenames -- different origin than earlier modules)

    **Progression check:**
    - For each module boundary (1->2, 2->3, ..., 20->21):
      - Does the first lesson of the next module build on what was just taught?
      - Is there an assumed concept that wasn't covered?
      - Is the difficulty jump reasonable?
    - Use findings from 03-02 SUMMARY as a checklist -- verify flagged transitions have been addressed or are acceptable

    **Difficulty calibration:**
    - Are Modules 01-04 genuinely beginner-friendly?
    - Is the jump from fundamentals (M01-09) to TypeScript (M10) manageable?
    - Is the jump from TypeScript (M10) to backend (M11) smooth?
    - Are the capstones (M20-21) achievable by a student who completed all prior modules?

    **Do NOT rewrite content in this task** unless there are fewer than 5 small voice issues to fix. Flag systemic issues for a potential Phase 3.1 follow-up.

  <name>Task 3: Human verification of complete JavaScript course audit</name>
  <action>
    Present the completed audit results to the user for final verification. All automated work (Plans 03-01 through 03-07 Tasks 1-2) has been completed. The user now verifies the results by spot-checking key changes in the WPF app.
  </action>
  <what-built>
    Complete JavaScript course audit: 132 lessons across 21 modules verified against ES2024+/ES2025/Node.js 22 LTS. Key changes:
    - 143 non-standard filenames renamed (code.md -> example.md, concept.md -> theory.md, pitfalls.md -> warning.md)
    - TypeScript 7.0 misinformation corrected in Module 17
    - Hono JWT middleware updated with required alg parameter (Modules 11, 20)
    - Docker images updated from oven/bun:1.1 to oven/bun:1 (Modules 15, 20)
    - ES2025 features verified as finalized (Set methods, Iterator helpers, Promise.try)
    - Decorator status accurately described (Stage 3, transpiler-only)
    - Module 16 testing challenges verified with bun:test simulation wrappers
    - Module 19 Bun-specific challenges handled (simulation or conceptual markers)
    - Both capstones (M20 API + M21 Full-Stack) verified for completeness and deployability
    - Version manifest and course.json updated
    - refactor_course.py artifact deleted
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Open the WPF app and navigate to the JavaScript course
    2. Verify course description shows "132 lessons" (not "95 lessons")
    3. Navigate to Module 05 -- verify Set methods described as ES2025 finalized (not proposal)
    4. Navigate to Module 11 Lesson 04 or 06 -- verify JWT middleware has alg parameter in examples
    5. Navigate to Module 15 Lesson 06 -- verify Docker examples use oven/bun:1 (not 1.1)
    6. Navigate to Module 17 Lesson 04 -- verify TypeScript 7.0 warning is corrected
    7. Navigate to Module 18 Lesson 05 -- verify decorators described as Stage 3, not natively shipped
    8. Open a Module 16 challenge -- verify simulation wrapper is present at top of solution
    9. Open a Module 20 capstone lesson -- verify content renders correctly after filename rename
    10. Navigate to Module 21 Lesson 10 (production deploy) -- verify deployment instructions exist
