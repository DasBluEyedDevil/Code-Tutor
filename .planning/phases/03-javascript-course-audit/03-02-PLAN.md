<objective>
Perform a read-only structural review of all 21 modules (132 lessons) in the JavaScript course: analyze module ordering, lesson progression, prerequisite chains, knowledge cliffs at transitions, missing content sections, and Bun-specific challenge compatibility. No content changes -- only analysis and documentation.

Purpose: This assessment guides all subsequent accuracy passes (03-03 through 03-06) by identifying where to focus editing effort. It also determines whether any module reordering is needed (high-risk) vs. within-module lesson reordering (lower-risk).

Output: A comprehensive SUMMARY documenting the structural health of the JS course with specific actionable findings for each accuracy pass plan.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Module ordering and lesson progression analysis</name>
  <files>
    (read-only: all module.json and lesson.json files across 21 modules)
  </files>
  <action>
    Read every module.json and every lesson.json across all 21 modules. For each module, record:
    - Module title, lesson count, challenge count
    - First lesson title (entry point) and last lesson title (exit point)
    - Difficulty metadata

    Then analyze:

    **1. Module ordering assessment:**
    - Is the fundamentals-to-advanced progression logical?
    - Evaluate these specific concerns from research:
      a. Module 08 Lesson 03 (Import Attributes) appears before Lesson 04 (CJS vs ESM). Import Attributes make no sense without understanding module systems first. Should these swap?
      b. Module 17 (JSDoc) comes after Module 10 (TypeScript). Is "types without TS" useful after learning TS? Or is this intentionally positioned as an alternative approach for existing JS codebases?
      c. Module 16 (Testing) sits between Deployment (M15) and JSDoc (M17). Would testing be better placed earlier (after backend M11-12, before integration M14)?

    **2. Prerequisite chain verification:**
    For each module transition (1->2, 2->3, ..., 20->21), check:
    - Does the first lesson of the next module explicitly reference or build on prior module content?
    - Is there assumed knowledge that was never taught?
    - Key transitions to scrutinize:
      a. M06 (Functions) -> M07 (DOM): Does DOM intro explain HTML/CSS basics or assume them?
      b. M09 (Error Handling) -> M10 (TypeScript): Is TS intro accessible to pure JS learners?
      c. M12 (Prisma) -> M13 (React): Frontend after backend -- is the transition smooth?
      d. M15 (Deployment) -> M16 (Testing): Testing after deployment feels backward
      e. M18 (ES2025) -> M19 (Advanced Bun): Advanced Bun after ES2025 modern patterns -- logical?

    **3. Knowledge cliff detection:**
    For each module, read the first theory section of lesson 01 and estimate the difficulty jump from the previous module's last lesson. Flag any jumps > 2 levels (e.g., beginner -> advanced without intermediate).

    **4. Content section inventory:**
    For each module, count:
    - Lessons with ANALOGY sections (missing analogies = 32 lessons per research)
    - Lessons with KEY_POINT sections (only 17 files total per research)
    - Lessons with WARNING sections
    Document which modules are missing analogies (M16, M20, M21 expected to be zero)

    **5. Bun-specific challenge audit:**
    For Modules 16, 19, and 20, examine each challenge's solution.js and starter.js:
    - Which challenges use the simulation wrapper pattern (Node.js compatible)?
    - Which challenges use raw Bun APIs (will NOT run in Node.js)?
    - Classify each as: "has simulation" | "needs simulation" | "conceptual only (cannot simulate)"

    For "conceptual only" challenges (e.g., bun:ffi, bun:sqlite), recommend marking them with a comment explaining they require Bun runtime to execute.

    **6. ES2025 overlap detection:**
    Module 18 (ES2025 Modern Patterns) covers features that may already appear in earlier modules:
    - Promise.try (M08 async?), Set methods (M05 data structures?), Iterator helpers (M05?)
    Check whether M18 is redundant vs. a consolidation module that goes deeper.

    Document ALL findings in the SUMMARY. Do NOT make any content changes in this plan.

    No commits (read-only plan).

  <verify>
    - SUMMARY contains a section for each of the 6 analysis areas above
    - Every module transition (20 transitions) is assessed
    - Bun-specific challenges are individually classified
    - Specific actionable findings are tagged to the accuracy pass plan that should address them (03-03 through 03-06)
  </verify>
  <done>Complete structural assessment documented in SUMMARY. Module ordering recommendations, knowledge cliff risks, missing content sections, and Bun challenge strategy all catalogued with specific plan assignments.</done>

<verification>
After the task completes:
1. SUMMARY exists with structured findings
2. All 21 modules and 132 lessons have been inventoried
3. Specific issues are tagged to accuracy pass plans (03-03 through 03-06)
4. No files were modified (read-only plan)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- JSCR-02 partially satisfied: Progression analysis complete, gaps identified for remediation in later plans
- Structural assessment provides a roadmap for all accuracy passes
- Bun challenge strategy documented for implementation in 03-05 and 03-06
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-javascript-course-audit/03-02-SUMMARY.md`

The SUMMARY must include these sections:
1. **Module Inventory Table** (module, lessons, challenges, difficulty, entry/exit)
2. **Module Ordering Assessment** (each concern with recommendation: reorder vs. accept)
3. **Prerequisite Chain Analysis** (each transition rated: smooth / minor gap / knowledge cliff)
4. **Missing Content Sections** (which modules need analogies, key_points)
5. **Bun Challenge Classification** (each challenge: has simulation / needs simulation / conceptual only)
6. **ES2025 Overlap Analysis** (what overlaps with earlier modules)
7. **Findings by Plan** (which issues should be fixed in 03-03, 03-04, 03-05, 03-06, 03-07)
