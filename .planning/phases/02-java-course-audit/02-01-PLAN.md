<objective>
Update Java course metadata to target Java 25 LTS and Spring Boot 4.0.x, fix all outdated version references in lesson titles and directory names, remove --enable-preview flags, and perform a structural review of the 16-module curriculum to identify progression gaps, missing prerequisites, and ordering issues.

Purpose: Establishes the version foundation that all subsequent plans depend on, and produces a structural assessment that guides the content accuracy pass. Version references in titles and directories must be fixed first because they affect how every other plan references files.

Output: Updated version-manifest.json and course.json, renamed lesson directories with corrected version references, structural review notes in the SUMMARY.

  <name>Task 2: Fix outdated version references in titles, directories, and metadata + structural review</name>

    All lesson.json and module.json files with version references
  </files>
  <action>
    **1. Rename lesson directories that embed outdated Java version numbers:**

    These lesson directory names contain version numbers that are now wrong:
    - `06-lesson-16-modern-java-syntax-writing-less-code-java-23` -> `06-lesson-16-modern-java-syntax-writing-less-code`
      (Remove "java-23" -- the lesson is about compact source files which are now standard Java 25 syntax, not a version-specific feature to call out in the title)
    - `06-lesson-56-lambda-expressions-functions-as-data-java-8` -> `06-lesson-56-lambda-expressions-functions-as-data`
      (Remove "java-8" -- lambdas have been standard Java for 11 years, no need for version tag)
    - `07-lesson-57-streams-functional-collection-processing-java-8` -> `07-lesson-57-streams-functional-collection-processing`
      (Remove "java-8" -- same reasoning)
    - `05-lesson-c5-virtual-threads-java-21` -> `05-lesson-c5-virtual-threads`
      (Remove "java-21" -- virtual threads finalized in Java 21 but are standard in Java 25)

    Use `git mv` for each rename to preserve history.

    **2. Update lesson.json title fields inside each renamed directory:**
    - Remove "Java 23", "Java 8", "Java 21" from lesson titles in lesson.json
    - Example: "Modern Java Syntax: Writing Less Code (Java 23)" -> "Modern Java Syntax: Writing Less Code"
    - Example: "Lambda Expressions: Functions as Data (Java 8+)" -> "Lambda Expressions: Functions as Data"

    **3. Update module.json files with version references:**
    - Module 07 (concurrency): If description references "Java 21 virtual threads", update to just "virtual threads"
    - Any module.json with "Java 21" or "Java 23" references: update or remove version tag

    **4. Remove --enable-preview from all files:**
    Search the entire Java course for `enable-preview` and remove any references. There are 2 known files:
    - `content/courses/java/modules/01-java-fundamentals/lessons/05-lesson-15-switch-expressions-pattern-matching/content/07-key_point.md`
    - `content/courses/java/modules/15-full-stack-development/lessons/07-lesson-157-virtual-threads-project-loom-modern-concurrency/content/07-theory.md`

    In each file, remove the `--enable-preview` reference and update the surrounding text to note that these features are finalized in Java 25 (no special flags needed).

    **5. Structural review of module ordering and progression:**
    Read through ALL 16 module.json files and their lesson lists (lesson.json title/order). Document in the SUMMARY:
    - Current module progression path (is Module 03 Git in the right place? Does OOP come before collections?)
    - Any lessons that assume knowledge from a later module (prerequisite violations)
    - Missing bridge lessons at major transitions (fundamentals->OOP, OOP->collections, collections->Spring Boot)
    - Whether Module 13 (React) and Module 15 (Full-Stack) need restructuring for the dual capstone approach
    - **Thymeleaf prerequisite resolution:** Document that NO separate Thymeleaf module is needed. Plan 02-07 teaches Thymeleaf fundamentals in-context during the capstone (Lesson 06 "Frontend Development: Choose Your Path"). This is pedagogically sound because students learn Thymeleaf by building with it in the capstone project. The structural review should confirm this decision and note that the capstone Lesson 06 serves as a self-contained Thymeleaf tutorial for students choosing that path.

  <done>No Java course directory or lesson title contains outdated version numbers. No --enable-preview references remain. Structural review findings documented in SUMMARY with specific gap and progression issues identified, including confirmation that Thymeleaf is taught in-context in capstone Lesson 06 (no separate module needed).</done>
</task>

<verification>
After both tasks complete:
1. version-manifest.json has Java 25 and Spring Boot 4.0.x
2. course.json has Java 25 metadata
3. Zero directories with embedded version numbers (java-8, java-21, java-23)
4. Zero files with --enable-preview
5. Structural review findings exist in SUMMARY (progression gaps, module order, capstone plan, Thymeleaf prerequisite resolution)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- JAVA-01 partially satisfied: Version targets resolved globally
- JAVA-02 partially satisfied: Structural review identifies progression gaps for subsequent plans to address
- Version foundation established for all subsequent Phase 2 plans
- Renamed directories do not break any cross-references
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-java-course-audit/02-01-SUMMARY.md`

The SUMMARY must include a "Structural Review Findings" section documenting:
- Module ordering assessment
- Prerequisite chain violations found
- Missing bridge lessons
- Thymeleaf prerequisite resolution: No separate Thymeleaf module needed -- Plan 02-07 Lesson 06 teaches Thymeleaf fundamentals in-context during capstone build
- Specific lessons flagged for content issues (to be fixed in Plans 02-03 through 02-08)
</output>
