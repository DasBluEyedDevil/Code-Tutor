<objective>
Final verification pass across the entire Java course: confirm zero remaining System.out.println (except LEGACY_COMPARISON), zero stale version references, consistent voice and tone, and no knowledge gaps in the 16-module progression. Fix any stragglers found.

Purpose: Plans 02-07 each migrated specific modules. This plan performs a global sweep to catch anything missed, verify cross-module consistency, and ensure the voice is uniform from Module 1 to Module 16. This is the quality gate before the phase is marked complete.

Output: A verified Java course with zero known issues. Final checkpoint for human review.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Global search-and-fix for remaining issues</name>
  <files>
    content/courses/java/ (entire course tree)
  </files>
  <action>
    Run comprehensive searches across the ENTIRE Java course directory and fix any remaining issues.

    **Search 1: System.out.println survivors**
    ```
    grep -r "System.out.println" content/courses/java/
    ```
    Expected: 0 results, OR exactly 1 result inside a LEGACY_COMPARISON section.
    If any found: fix them (replace with IO.println).
    Also search for `System.out.print(` (without ln) and `System.err.println`.

    **Search 2: Stale version references**
    ```
    grep -ri "Java 21\|Java 23\|Java 24\|JDK 21\|JDK 23\|JDK 24" content/courses/java/
    grep -ri "Spring Boot 3\." content/courses/java/
    grep -ri "temurin:21\|openjdk:21" content/courses/java/
    grep -ri "enable-preview" content/courses/java/
    ```
    Fix any remaining. Exclude historical mentions in LEGACY_COMPARISON sections.

    **Search 3: Deprecated annotations**
    ```
    grep -r "@MockBean" content/courses/java/
    grep -r "WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter" content/courses/java/
    grep -r "antMatchers" content/courses/java/
    ```
    Fix any remaining.

    **Search 4: All challenge.json files are valid JSON**
    For every challenge.json file under content/courses/java/:
    - Parse with `node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('path','utf8'))"` or equivalent
    - Report and fix any invalid JSON

    **Search 5: All lesson.json files are valid JSON**
    Same validation for lesson.json files.

    **Search 6: Module import declarations (JEP 511)**
    In modules that use many imports from java.base (especially Modules 05-07 with streams, collections, etc.), consider whether `import module java.base;` would simplify the code. If any content files have lengthy import lists, note it as an improvement opportunity but do NOT rewrite (this is accuracy pass, not optimization).

    **Fix all issues found.** Document every fix in the commit message.

    Run ALL searches again after fixes and confirm zero results for each:

  <name>Task 2: Voice consistency and progression review</name>
  <files>
    content/courses/java/ (read-only scan of all modules)
  </files>
  <action>
    Read the FIRST content file (usually 01-theory.md) of every lesson across all 16 modules (96 lessons). Check for:

    **Voice consistency:**
    - Every lesson should use friendly mentor tone (warm, encouraging, uses analogies)
    - Look for sudden shifts: overly formal/academic sections, condescending "baby talk", or dry reference-manual style
    - Flag any lessons where the voice is noticeably different from the rest

    **Progression check:**
    - For each module boundary (1->2, 2->3, ..., 15->16):
      - Does the first lesson of the next module build on what was just taught?
      - Is there an assumed concept that wasn't covered?
      - Is the difficulty jump reasonable?
    - Pay special attention to these known transition points:
      - Module 03 (Git) -> Module 04 (OOP): Does OOP intro reference "you've been using compact syntax"?
      - Module 09 (Databases) -> Module 10 (Web): Is there a bridge connecting JDBC to web APIs?
      - Module 12 (Security) -> Module 13 (React): Is the React intro smooth for Java-focused students?
      - Module 15 (Full-Stack) -> Module 16 (Capstone): Does the capstone build on everything?

    **Difficulty calibration:**
    - Are Modules 01-02 genuinely beginner-friendly?
    - Do the advanced modules (07 Concurrency, 12 Security) explain concepts fully?
    - Is Module 16 (Capstone) achievable by a student who completed all prior modules?

    **Do NOT rewrite content in this task.** Flag issues only. Add findings to the SUMMARY.

    If there are a small number of voice issues (< 5 files), fix them. If there are systemic voice issues, document them as a gap for a potential Phase 2.1 follow-up.

  <name>Task 3: Human verification of complete Java course audit</name>
  <action>
    Present the completed audit results to the user for final verification. All automated work (Plans 02-01 through 02-08 Tasks 1-2) has been completed. The user now verifies the results by spot-checking key changes in the WPF app. Summarize what was built, provide specific verification steps, and wait for approval or issue reports.
  </action>
  <what-built>
    Complete Java course audit: 96 lessons across 16 modules migrated to Java 25 LTS and Spring Boot 4.0.x. Key changes:
    - All System.out.println replaced with IO.println (97 files)
    - All version references updated (Java 25, Spring Boot 4.0.x)
    - Compact source file syntax in early modules, full class syntax from Module 04
    - One LEGACY_COMPARISON section for System.out.println
    - Flexible constructor bodies (JEP 513) in constructors lesson
    - @MockitoBean replacing @MockBean throughout
    - Docker images use eclipse-temurin:25
    - Dual capstone paths: Thymeleaf (with complete in-context tutorial) and React (advanced)
    - Deployment targeting Railway
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Open the WPF app and navigate to the Java course
    2. Verify Module 01 Lesson 02 shows IO.println and compact syntax in content
    3. Verify Module 04 Lesson 01 has explicit transition from compact to class syntax
    4. Verify Module 11 references Spring Boot 4.0 (not 3.4)
    5. Verify Module 16 Lesson 01 mentions both Thymeleaf and React paths
    6. Verify Module 16 Lesson 06 contains Thymeleaf tutorial with th:each, th:text, th:action, th:object, th:if, and fragment examples
    7. Spot-check 2-3 challenges: open a challenge, verify solution uses IO.println
    8. Spot-check Module 14: verify Dockerfile examples use eclipse-temurin:25
    9. Read through Module 01 Lesson 06 LEGACY_COMPARISON section
