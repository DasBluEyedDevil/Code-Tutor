<objective>
Migrate Modules 04-05 (OOP and Collections/Functional Programming) to Java 25 standards. Module 04 is the critical transition point where students move from compact source files to full class declarations. Module 05 has the worst System.out.println density and version-tagged lesson titles.

Purpose: Module 04 is the most pedagogically sensitive -- it must explicitly bridge "you've been using void main()" to "now you need classes." Module 05 contains 7 lessons with heavy System.out.println usage and "Java 8" version tags that make standard features sound legacy.

Output: All content and challenge files in Modules 04-05 updated to Java 25 standards with proper OOP transition and modernized collections/FP content.

    Module 04 has 8 lessons and 20 challenges. This is where students transition from compact syntax to full OOP.

    **Lesson 01 (Classes and Objects) -- CRITICAL TRANSITION:**
    - This lesson must explicitly bridge: "Until now, you've written code in compact source files with void main(). Now we're going to learn WHY Java has classes..."
    - Open with acknowledgment of what students know (compact files, IO.println, methods)
    - Explain that classes are blueprints for creating objects (the standard OOP intro)
    - Show the `public class Student { ... }` syntax and explain each part
    - Note: "From this point forward, most of our code will use class declarations, because OOP is how real Java applications are built"
    - Replace all System.out.println with IO.println in examples

    **Lesson 02 (Constructors) -- ADD FLEXIBLE CONSTRUCTOR BODIES:**
    - Teach standard constructors first
    - Add a section about flexible constructor bodies (JEP 513, finalized in Java 25):
      - You can now write validation BEFORE calling super()
      - Show the pattern: `if (value <= 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException(...)` before `super()`
      - This is especially useful for validated constructors in inheritance
    - Replace all System.out.println with IO.println

    **Lessons 03-06 (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstract/Interfaces):**
    - Replace all System.out.println with IO.println
    - These lessons should use full class syntax (public class, proper method signatures)
    - Verify each lesson's code examples compile conceptually (classes reference each other correctly)
    - Check for any "Java 21" or other version references and update

    **Lesson 07 (Records) -- UPDATE TO JAVA 25 FINALIZED:**
    - Records have been standard since Java 16, but content may frame them as "new"
    - Present records as a standard Java feature for immutable data classes
    - Remove any "preview" or "new in Java X" framing
    - Replace System.out.println with IO.println in examples

    **Lesson 08 (Sealed Classes) -- UPDATE TO JAVA 25 FINALIZED:**
    - Sealed classes finalized in Java 17, should be presented as standard
    - Replace System.out.println with IO.println
    - Ensure pattern matching examples use Java 25 syntax

    **For ALL 20 challenges:**
    - Replace System.out.println with IO.println in solution.java and starter.java
    - Challenge solutions should use full class syntax (public class with proper structure)
    - Update challenge.json instructions if they reference System.out.println

    Module 05 has 7 lessons and 17 challenges. Multiple lessons have "Java 8" in their titles which was already addressed in Plan 01 (directory rename), but the CONTENT inside these lessons still needs updating.

    **For ALL 7 lessons:**
    1. Read every content/*.md file
    2. Replace every `System.out.println` with `IO.println`
    3. Remove any "Java 8" framing -- lambdas and streams are just "Java" now. They've been standard for 11 years.
       - BAD: "Java 8 introduced lambda expressions..."
       - GOOD: "Lambda expressions let you treat functions as values..."
       - If historical context is valuable, one brief mention: "Lambdas were added in Java 8 and have been a core part of Java ever since"
    4. Update any "Java 21" or other version references to "Java 25" where needed
    5. Ensure code examples use full class syntax (Module 04 already introduced classes)

    **Lesson 06 (Lambda Expressions) -- special attention:**
    - Remove "Java 8" from all content framing
    - Present lambdas as standard functional programming in Java
    - Ensure examples show lambdas with collections (List.forEach, stream().map(), etc.)
    - Check that challenge instructions don't reference "Java 8"

    **Lesson 07 (Streams) -- special attention:**
    - Remove "Java 8" from all content framing
    - Present streams as the standard way to process collections
    - Ensure examples show modern stream patterns
    - Verify Collectors usage is current

    **For ALL 17 challenges:**
    - Replace System.out.println with IO.println in all solution.java files
    - Update challenge.json if instructions reference "Java 8" or System.out.println
    - Verify starter.java files use IO.println

    **Update module.json:**
    - If the module description references "Java 8", remove or rephrase

After both tasks complete:
1. Zero System.out.println in Modules 04-05
2. Module 04 has explicit compact-to-class syntax transition
3. Flexible constructor bodies taught in Module 04
4. No "Java 8" framing in Module 05
5. All 37 challenges updated (solutions + starters use IO.println)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- JAVA-01 partially satisfied: Modules 04-05 use consistent IO.println
- JAVA-02 partially satisfied: OOP transition is explicit, no assumed knowledge gaps at the Module 04 boundary
- The critical pedagogical transition (compact -> OOP) is handled cleanly
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-java-course-audit/02-03-SUMMARY.md`
