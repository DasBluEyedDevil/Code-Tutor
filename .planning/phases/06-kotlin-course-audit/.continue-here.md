<current_state>
Phase 6 (Kotlin Course Audit) is fully planned with 10 plans in 6 waves. Research complete. Plans verified by checker. No execution has started yet -- all 10 plans are pending.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Research: 06-RESEARCH.md complete (Kotlin 2.3.0, Ktor 3.4.0, Exposed 1.0.0, Koin 4.1.1, Arrow 2.2.0)
- Planning: 10 PLAN.md files created (06-01 through 06-10)
- Plan verification: Checker passed all 8 verification dimensions
- ROADMAP.md: Updated with actual plan list (no more TBD stubs)
- All committed to git (f30f4a6d, 1499a578)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
All 10 plans need execution:

**Wave 1:**
- 06-01: Version alignment (Kotlin 2.3, 9 frameworks), fix M06 lesson ordering (SEVERE -- auth before routing), module title prefixes, delete artifacts

**Wave 2 (4 parallel):**
- 06-02: Accuracy pass M01-M05 (44 lessons -- basics, OOP, advanced, coroutines + overlap assessment)
- 06-03: Accuracy pass M06-M07 (25 lessons -- Ktor 3.4.0, Exposed 1.0.0, Compose MP 1.10.x + M06 forward ref fixes)
- 06-04: Accuracy pass M08-M12 (42 lessons -- SQLDelight, KMP Arch, Koin, Testing, Deployment + capstone assessment)
- 06-05: Accuracy pass M13-M15 (17 lessons -- Gradle, Arrow context params migration, K2 context receivers rewrite)

**Wave 3 (2 parallel):**
- 06-06: Challenge creation M01-M07 (~40 challenges, pure Kotlin + framework-independent)
- 06-07: Challenge creation M08-M15 (~40 challenges, including 0% coverage M13-M15)

**Wave 4:**
- 06-08: Capstone creation (Task Manager KMP: Ktor + Compose MP + SQLDelight + Koin + H2)

**Wave 5:**
- 06-09: Enrichment (~98 KEY_POINTs + ~18 analogies + ~10 warnings)

**Wave 6:**
- 06-10: Global verification sweep + human checkpoint
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Kotlin 2.3.0 as target (course content already uses 2.3.0, version manifest just needs updating)
- Context receivers -> context parameters migration in M15 L05 and M14 Arrow examples
- M06 lesson reorder via two-phase rename (temp dirs -> final dirs) to avoid filesystem conflicts
- Capstone: Task Manager KMP app extending M06 API, using H2 embedded DB (no external services)
- Challenge strategy: M01-M04 pure Kotlin (Piston/kotlinc compatible), M05-M15 framework-independent (pure logic extraction, stubs, or QUIZ)
- Arrow challenges: Students implement simplified Either/Option/Raise (no Arrow dependency required)
- Model profile: quality (opus for researcher+planner, sonnet for checker)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None -- planning complete and verified, ready for execution.
</blockers>

<context>
Phase 6 is the 5th course audit (after Java, JS, C#, Flutter). The Kotlin course is framework-dense (7+ distinct frameworks) but version alignment is already good -- the course content targets current stable versions. The main work is structural fixes (M06 ordering bug), challenge creation (80 lessons have zero challenges), capstone creation (missing entirely), and enrichment (only 30 KEY_POINTs across 128 lessons). The accuracy passes should be faster than Flutter since versions are already aligned.
</context>

<next_action>
Run `/gsd:execute-phase 6` to begin execution. Start with Plan 06-01 (Wave 1) which fixes the critical M06 lesson ordering bug and aligns versions. Then Wave 2 runs 4 accuracy passes in parallel.
</next_action>
