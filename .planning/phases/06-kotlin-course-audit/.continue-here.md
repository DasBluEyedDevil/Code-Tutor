<current_state>
Phase 6 (Kotlin Course Audit) is fully complete. All 10 plans executed across 6 waves, global verification passed, human approved. Ready for Phase 7 (Python Course Audit).
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Plan 06-01: Version alignment (Kotlin 2.3, 9 frameworks pinned), M06 lesson reorder (15 dirs), module title prefixes removed, artifacts deleted
- Plan 06-02: Accuracy pass M01-M05 (44 lessons verified, 3 corrections in M01 L10)
- Plan 06-03: Accuracy pass M06-M07 (25 lessons verified, M06 zero broken forward refs, M07 14 files fixed with platform annotations)
- Plan 06-04: Accuracy pass M08-M12 (42 lessons verified, docker-compose V2 fixes, M12 capstone assessed)
- Plan 06-05: Accuracy pass M13-M15 (17 lessons verified, 39 files modified, context receivers->parameters migration, Arrow Validated->zipOrAccumulate)
- Plan 06-06: Challenge creation M01-M07 (40 new challenges, 108 new files)
- Plan 06-07: Challenge creation M08-M15 (30 new challenges, 70 new files)
- Plan 06-08: TaskFlow KMP capstone (replaced ShopKotlin, 15 content files)
- Plan 06-09: Enrichment (108 KEY_POINTs, 14 ANALOGYs, 8 WARNINGs)
- Plan 06-10: Global verification (294 JSON validated, 37 files fixed, human approved)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
None for Phase 6. Phase is complete.

Next phase: Phase 7 (Python Course Audit) -- needs planning (`/gsd:plan-phase 7`)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Kotlin 2.3.0 as target (K2 compiler default, context parameters Beta)
- Context receivers -> context parameters migration across M14-M15
- TaskFlow KMP capstone replaces ShopKotlin (Android-only was incompatible with KMP goal)
- H2 embedded database for capstone (zero-setup)
- Pure logic extraction pattern for framework-dependent challenges
- Arrow challenges: students build Either/Option/Raise from scratch (no library dependency)
- 35 challenge.json files missing type field fixed in final sweep
</decisions_made>

<context>
Phase 6 was the 5th course audit (after Java, JS, C#, Flutter). Kotlin course was framework-dense (9 frameworks) but version alignment was already close -- the main work was structural fixes (M06 ordering bug), challenge creation (80+ new, raising from 37% to 100%), capstone creation (TaskFlow KMP replacing Android-only ShopKotlin), and enrichment (108 KEY_POINTs). Total execution: 110 min across 10 plans in 6 waves.

Overall project is at 44/61 plans complete (72%). 6 of 9 phases done. Python audit is next, then AI Tutor Enhancement and UI/Engagement.

<next_action>
Run `/gsd:plan-phase 7` to plan the Python Course Audit phase. Python has 24 modules (post-M14 restructure in Phase 1) and 171 lessons. Key concerns: malformed challenge.json in M01 L05 (pending todo), Python 3.12+ version alignment, FastAPI 0.115.x and Django 5.1.x verification.
