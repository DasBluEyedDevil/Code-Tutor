<objective>
Create missing challenges for Modules 08-15 (approximately 40+ new challenges). This covers the KMP ecosystem modules (some with gaps) and the three 0%-coverage modules (M13 Gradle, M14 Arrow, M15 K2 Era). All challenges must be framework-independent since these modules use SQLDelight, Koin, Compose, Arrow, and Gradle.

Purpose: KTLN-03 requires every lesson to have at least one coding challenge. M08 and M10-M11 are already 100%. M09 is 57%, M12 is 29%, and M13-M15 are 0%. This plan closes all remaining challenge gaps.
Output: ~40 new challenge directories with challenge.json, starter.kt, and solution.kt.

  <name>Task 1: Create challenges for M08-M12 (~16 challenges)</name>
  <files>
    New challenge directories in:
    content/courses/kotlin/modules/08-persistence-with-sqldelight/lessons/*/challenges/ (already 100%)
    content/courses/kotlin/modules/09-kmp-architecture-patterns/lessons/*/challenges/
    content/courses/kotlin/modules/10-dependency-injection-with-koin/lessons/*/challenges/ (already 100%)

    **Step 1: Identify lessons without challenges**
    - M08: Already 100% coverage -- skip
    - M09: 3 of 7 lessons missing challenges
    - M10: Already 100% coverage -- skip
    - M11: Already 100% coverage -- skip
    - M12: 10 of 14 lessons missing challenges (worst in this group)
    Total: ~13 lessons need challenges

    **Step 2: Review existing challenge patterns from these modules**
    Read 2-3 existing challenges from M08, M10, M11 to understand the pattern used for KMP ecosystem challenges. These likely use QUIZ or conceptual challenge formats since they depend on frameworks.

    **Step 3: Challenge design for M09 KMP Architecture (3 missing)**
    - Architecture patterns can be tested via pure Kotlin: "Implement a simple MVI state machine" (sealed class State, sealed class Intent, reduce function)
    - ViewModel pattern: "Create a ViewModel class that manages state via StateFlow" (pure kotlinx.coroutines, no Android deps)
    - Use code-review style if pattern is too framework-dependent

    **Step 4: Challenge design for M12 Deployment (10 missing)**
    Deployment lessons are the hardest to create challenges for. Approach by lesson type:
    - CI/CD lessons: QUIZ type (questions about GitHub Actions workflow configuration)
    - Docker lessons: "Write a function that validates a Dockerfile configuration" (pure string parsing)
    - Security lessons: "Implement a CORS configuration validator" or "Write a function that checks API key format"
    - Cloud deployment: QUIZ type (conceptual understanding of deployment strategies)
    - App store: QUIZ type (process questions)
    - KMP publishing: "Write a function that generates a Maven POM XML" (pure string building)

    Not every challenge needs to be FREE_CODING. For deployment/process lessons, QUIZ challenges are appropriate and match the content type.

    **Step 5: Create all challenge files**
    For each new challenge, create challenge.json + starter.kt + solution.kt following the same schema and patterns established by existing challenges.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Count total new challenges for M08-M12.
    Verify M09 and M12 now have 100% coverage.
    Verify each new challenge has all 3 files.
    Verify no framework imports required in standalone challenges.
  </verify>
  <done>
    ~16 new challenges created for M09 and M12. All M08-M12 modules at 100% challenge coverage. Deployment challenges use appropriate QUIZ or pure-logic extraction format.

    New challenge directories in:
    content/courses/kotlin/modules/13-gradle-mastery-for-kotlin-developers/lessons/*/challenges/
    content/courses/kotlin/modules/14-functional-kotlin-with-arrow/lessons/*/challenges/

    These three modules have ZERO existing challenges. All 17 lessons need challenges.

    **M13 Gradle Mastery (6 lessons, 6 new challenges):**
    Gradle challenges should test understanding of build configuration without requiring actual Gradle execution:
    - Kotlin DSL lesson: "Write a function that parses a simplified build.gradle.kts dependency block and returns a list of dependency coordinates" (pure string parsing)
    - Version catalogs lesson: "Write a TOML parser that extracts version, library, and plugin entries from a simplified libs.versions.toml format" (pure parsing)
    - Multiplatform builds lesson: QUIZ about KMP source set structure (commonMain, androidMain, iosMain)
    - Custom plugins lesson: "Implement a function that applies convention settings to a project configuration object" (pure Kotlin with data classes representing config)
    - Build optimization lesson: QUIZ about caching strategies and incremental compilation
    - Advanced builds lesson: "Write a function that resolves dependency version conflicts using a version catalog" (pure logic)

    **M14 Arrow Functional Kotlin (6 lessons, 6 new challenges):**
    Arrow challenges CAN be pure Kotlin for the core concepts (Either, Option are just sealed classes):
    - FP principles: "Implement a pipe/compose function that chains transformations" (pure Kotlin)
    - Either: "Implement a simplified Either<L, R> sealed class with map, flatMap, and fold" (pure Kotlin -- students build their own!)
    - Option: "Implement a simplified Option<A> with map, flatMap, and getOrElse" (pure Kotlin)
    - Raise DSL: "Implement a result-builder pattern using Kotlin's context parameters" (requires Kotlin 2.2+ features -- note Piston limitation, design for local execution)
    - Railway-oriented programming: "Chain multiple validation functions that return Either, collecting all errors" (pure Kotlin with student-implemented Either)
    - Advanced patterns: "Implement zipOrAccumulate for a list of Either values" (pure Kotlin)

    For M14, DO NOT use Arrow library imports. Instead, have students implement simplified versions of the FP constructs. This tests understanding AND is executable without Arrow dependency.

    **M15 K2 Era (5 lessons, 5 new challenges):**
    - K2 Compiler: QUIZ about K2 features and improvements
    - K2 Migration: "Write a function that identifies deprecated Kotlin patterns in a code string" (pure string analysis -- detecting old patterns like `header/impl`, `@JvmDefault`, etc.)
    - KSP basics: "Implement a simplified annotation processor that extracts annotated function names from a code string" (pure string parsing)
    - KSP advanced: "Write a code generator function that produces a Builder class for a given data class definition" (pure string transformation)
    - Context Parameters: "Implement a function that uses context parameters to provide logging and metrics without passing them as regular parameters" (requires -Xcontext-parameters -- note Piston limitation, design for local execution)

    **Step: Create all challenge files**
    For each new challenge, create challenge.json + starter.kt + solution.kt. Follow the same schema.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Count total new challenges for M13-M15 (should be 17).
    Verify each lesson in M13-M15 now has at least one challenge.
    Verify M14 challenges do NOT import Arrow (use pure Kotlin FP implementations).
    Verify each new challenge has all 3 files.
    Spot-check 3-4 solution.kt files for correctness.
  </verify>
  <done>
    17 new challenges created across M13-M15 (from 0% to 100% coverage). Arrow challenges use pure Kotlin FP implementations. Gradle/K2 challenges use appropriate QUIZ or pure-logic formats. All 128 lessons now have at least one challenge.
  </done>
