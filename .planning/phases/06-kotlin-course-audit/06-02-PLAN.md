<objective>
Verify Modules 01-05 (44 lessons, ~600 content files) against Kotlin 2.3.0 and kotlinx.coroutines 1.10.x. Fix any deprecated patterns, inaccurate API references, or outdated idioms. Assess the M04/M05 coroutines overlap.

Purpose: KTLN-01 requires every lesson accurate against Kotlin 2.0+ with K2 compiler. Modules 01-05 cover pure Kotlin fundamentals -- the foundation everything else builds on. Any inaccuracies here propagate to every subsequent module.
Output: Verified M01-M05 content files with corrections applied. M04/M05 coroutines overlap assessment.

  <action>
    Read all content files across M01-M03 (24 lessons, ~330 content files). For each lesson, verify:

    **Kotlin 2.3 accuracy checks:**
    - Variable declarations use correct syntax (val/var, type inference)
    - Null safety patterns are current (?.let, ?:, !!, safe casts)
    - String templates use correct syntax
    - When expressions use correct syntax (including exhaustive checks for sealed classes)
    - Data classes, sealed classes, value classes use current patterns
    - No deprecated Kotlin 1.x patterns (e.g., old enum syntax, deprecated stdlib functions)
    - No incorrect version attributions (e.g., claiming a feature is "new in Kotlin 2.0" when it's been stable since 1.x)

    **OOP accuracy checks (M03):**
    - Inheritance uses current Kotlin patterns (open/abstract/sealed, constructor delegation)
    - Interface default methods use correct syntax
    - Data class copy(), destructuring use current patterns
    - Sealed class/interface hierarchies are correct
    - Object declarations and companion objects use current patterns

    **Content quality checks:**
    - No placeholder or stub content (empty theory sections, TODO markers)
    - Code examples compile (mentally verify -- no execution needed for pure Kotlin)
    - Lesson progression makes sense within each module
    - No knowledge cliffs (referencing concepts not yet introduced)

    Fix any inaccuracies in-place. Track changes for the summary.

  <verify>
    Report: X lessons reviewed, Y corrections applied, Z inaccuracies found.
    Grep for common deprecated patterns across M01-M03: "experimentalStdlibApi", "JvmDefault", "header/impl" (old multiplatform syntax).
    Verify no version-tagged framing exists (e.g., "new in Kotlin 1.9", "since Kotlin 2.0").
  </verify>

    All 24 lessons in M01-M03 verified against Kotlin 2.3.0. Deprecated patterns fixed. No knowledge cliffs or inaccurate version claims.

  </files>
  <action>
    Read all content files across M04-M05 (20 lessons, ~270 content files).

    **M04 Advanced Kotlin (13 lessons):**
    - FP: Higher-order functions, lambdas, function types use current syntax
    - Collections: Verify sequence vs. iterable guidance, collection builders
    - Scope functions (let, run, with, apply, also): Correct usage patterns
    - Generics: Variance (in/out), reified type parameters, star projection
    - DSL builders: Verify @DslMarker, lambda-with-receiver patterns
    - Coroutines basics (L08): launch, async, runBlocking -- verify these match kotlinx.coroutines 1.10.x
    - Advanced coroutines (L09): Verify content exists and doesn't duplicate M05

    **M05 Coroutines & Flows (7 lessons):**
    - Structured concurrency: coroutineScope, supervisorScope, Job hierarchy
    - Dispatchers: Dispatchers.Main, IO, Default, Unconfined -- verify correct descriptions
    - Exception handling: CoroutineExceptionHandler, supervisorScope patterns
    - Flow: flow builder, collect, map, filter, combine -- verify current API
    - StateFlow/SharedFlow: Verify current patterns (not deprecated ConflatedBroadcastChannel)
    - Verify kotlinx.coroutines version references match 1.10.x

    **M04/M05 coroutines overlap assessment:**
    Compare M04 L08-L09 with M05 L01-L02 (likely the overlap zone):
    - If M04 L08-L09 serve as a brief preview (introducing coroutines concept, basic launch/async), and M05 goes deeper (structured concurrency, exception handling, Flow), then keep both with a clear note in M04 that M05 covers coroutines comprehensively.
    - If M04 L08-L09 substantially duplicate M05 content (same depth, same examples), then trim M04 L08-L09 to be a brief transition paragraph pointing to M05, or add a "preview" framing.
    - Do NOT remove lessons (would break IDs). Instead, reframe M04 coroutines lessons as "Introduction to Asynchronous Programming" that sets up M05.
    Document the overlap assessment and any reframing done in the summary.

    **Common checks:**
    - No version-tagged framing ("new in Kotlin X.Y")
    - No references to experimental APIs that are now stable (e.g., contracts, inline classes now value classes)
    - No deprecated stdlib functions (e.g., capitalize() -> replaceFirstChar {})
  </action>
  <verify>
    Report: X lessons reviewed, Y corrections applied, Z inaccuracies found.
    Document M04/M05 overlap verdict: kept/trimmed/reframed.
    Grep for deprecated coroutines patterns: "GlobalScope", "ConflatedBroadcastChannel", "BroadcastChannel", "ObservableProperty".
    Verify no Kotlin version tags remain in content.
  </verify>
  <done>
    All 20 lessons in M04-M05 verified against Kotlin 2.3.0 and kotlinx.coroutines 1.10.x. M04/M05 coroutines overlap assessed and resolved. Deprecated patterns fixed.
