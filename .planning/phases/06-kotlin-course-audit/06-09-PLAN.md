<objective>
Add KEY_POINT content files to all 128 lessons (~98 new files, 30 already exist), add ANALOGY files to zero-analogy modules, and add WARNING files to zero-warning modules. This is the enrichment pass that balances content types across the course.

Purpose: KTLN-05 requires KEY_POINTs throughout (currently only 30 across 128 lessons -- 9 modules have zero). The course also has severe analogy and warning gaps. This enrichment makes each lesson more memorable and complete.
Output: ~98 new KEY_POINT files, ~20 new ANALOGY files, ~10 new WARNING files.

  <name>Task 1: KEY_POINT enrichment for all 128 lessons</name>

    New *-key_point.md files in content/courses/kotlin/modules/*/lessons/*/content/
  </files>
  <action>
    **Step 1: Inventory existing KEY_POINTs**
    Research identified 30 existing KEY_POINTs:
    - M01: 1, M03: 3, M04: 7, M06: 17, M07: 1, M12: 1
    - M02, M05, M08-M11, M13-M15: ZERO

    Scan all 128 lessons and build the complete list of which lessons already have KEY_POINT files and which need new ones. Target: every lesson gets at least one KEY_POINT.

    **Step 2: Create KEY_POINT files (~98 new files)**
    For each lesson WITHOUT a KEY_POINT, create a new content file:

    Filename convention: `{next_number}-key_point.md` where next_number = highest existing content file number + 1
    Frontmatter: `type: KEY_POINT`

    Content: 2-4 sentences that capture the SINGLE most important takeaway from the lesson. Follow the pattern established by existing KEY_POINTs in the course.

    Guidelines for KEY_POINT content:
    - Start with a bold statement of the key concept
    - Follow with why it matters or when to use it
    - Keep to 2-4 sentences (not a paragraph rewrite of the theory)
    - Use imperative/direct voice: "Always prefer val over var" not "It is recommended to prefer val"
    - Reference the specific Kotlin/framework feature taught in that lesson

    **Module-specific KEY_POINT guidance:**
    - M01-M03 (basics): Focus on Kotlin-specific idioms that differ from Java/other languages
    - M04 (advanced): Focus on when to use each feature (scope functions, generics patterns)
    - M05 (coroutines): Focus on structured concurrency rules and common mistakes
    - M06 (Ktor): Focus on Ktor-specific patterns (plugin system, routing DSL, Exposed transactions)
    - M07 (Compose MP): Focus on state management and composition principles
    - M08-M10 (KMP ecosystem): Focus on multiplatform patterns and platform-specific considerations
    - M11 (testing): Focus on testing strategies for shared vs platform code
    - M12 (deployment): Focus on critical deployment decisions and security
    - M13 (Gradle): Focus on build configuration best practices
    - M14 (Arrow): Focus on when FP patterns add value vs over-engineering
    - M15 (K2): Focus on migration priorities and tooling choices

    Process in batches by module to maintain consistency within each module.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Count total KEY_POINT files across all 128 lessons (should be 128+, one per lesson minimum).
    Verify frontmatter is `type: KEY_POINT` for all new files.
    Spot-check 5-6 KEY_POINTs across different modules for quality and relevance.
    Verify no duplicate KEY_POINT content within a module.
    Grep for "KEY_POINT" type in new files to count.
  </verify>
  <done>
    ~98 new KEY_POINT files created. Every lesson in the Kotlin course (128 total) has at least one KEY_POINT. Content is module-appropriate and follows existing KEY_POINT style.

    New *-analogy.md files in content/courses/kotlin/modules/*/lessons/*/content/
    New *-warning.md files in content/courses/kotlin/modules/*/lessons/*/content/
  </files>
  <action>
    **ANALOGY enrichment:**
    Research identified these modules have ZERO analogies: M07, M08, M11, M12, M13, M14, M15 (7 modules).
    Target: 2-3 ANALOGY files per zero-analogy module = ~18 new files.

    For each zero-analogy module, add analogies to introductory and key concept lessons:
    - M07 (Compose MP): L01 intro (UI as recipe ingredients), L03 state (state as a whiteboard)
    - M08 (SQLDelight): L01 intro (SQLDelight as a translator between SQL and Kotlin), L04 reactive queries (reactive queries as a news ticker)
    - M11 (Testing): L01 intro (testing as quality inspection), L03 mocking (mocking as a stunt double)
    - M12 (Deployment): L01 intro (deployment as a product launch), L04 security (security as building locks)
    - M13 (Gradle): L01 intro (Gradle as a factory assembly line), L03 multiplatform (KMP builds as multilingual publishing)
    - M14 (Arrow): L01 FP principles (FP as a conveyor belt), L03 Raise (error handling as railway switches)
    - M15 (K2 Era): L01 K2 compiler (K2 as a new engine in an existing car), L05 context params (context as ambient music in a room)

    Each ANALOGY file:
    - Filename: `{next_number}-analogy.md`
    - Frontmatter: `type: ANALOGY`
    - Content: 1-3 paragraphs comparing the technical concept to a real-world scenario
    - Use everyday objects/experiences (not other technical domains)
    - Read existing analogies in M01-M06 for style reference

    **WARNING enrichment:**
    Research identified these modules have ZERO warnings: M03, M06, M07, M15 (4 modules).
    Target: 2-3 WARNING files per zero-warning module = ~10 new files.

    - M03 (OOP): L02 inheritance (diamond problem/deep hierarchies), L05 sealed classes (exhaustive when pitfalls)
    - M06 (Ktor): L09 validation (never trust client input), L10 auth (password storage anti-patterns)
    - M07 (Compose MP): L02 state (recomposition performance), L06 navigation (back stack management)
    - M15 (K2): L02 migration (incremental migration approach), L05 context params (Beta feature stability)

    Each WARNING file:
    - Filename: `{next_number}-warning.md`
    - Frontmatter: `type: WARNING`
    - Content: A specific pitfall, common mistake, or gotcha related to the lesson topic
    - Start with what goes wrong, explain why, and show how to avoid it
    - Read existing WARNINGs in the course for style reference
  </action>
  <verify>
    Count new ANALOGY files (target: ~18).
    Count new WARNING files (target: ~10).
    Verify each zero-analogy module now has at least 2 ANALOGY files.
    Verify each zero-warning module now has at least 2 WARNING files.
    Verify frontmatter types are correct (ANALOGY, WARNING).
    Spot-check analogies for real-world relevance (not too technical).
  </verify>
  <done>
    ~18 new ANALOGY files across 7 zero-analogy modules. ~10 new WARNING files across 4 zero-warning modules. Content type distribution significantly improved. Every module now has at least some representation of each non-theory content type.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Every lesson has at least one KEY_POINT (128 total lessons checked)
2. Zero-analogy modules each have 2+ ANALOGY files
3. Zero-warning modules each have 2+ WARNING files
4. All new content files have correct frontmatter types
5. Content quality: KEY_POINTs are concise takeaways, ANALOGYs use everyday comparisons, WARNINGs describe specific pitfalls
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- KTLN-05 addressed: KEY_POINTs throughout (30 -> 128+), content balanced with analogies and warnings
- Zero-analogy modules (7) enriched with 2+ analogies each
- Zero-warning modules (4) enriched with 2+ warnings each
- Content type distribution rebalanced from heavily THEORY-dominated
