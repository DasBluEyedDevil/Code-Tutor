<objective>
Perform final voice and polish pass across all Python lessons, integrate Git/developer tools content throughout the course, ensure consistent difficulty progression, and complete final verification for production readiness.

Purpose: Satisfy PYTH-05 (consistent voice, tone, difficulty progression) and complete the Python course audit. This is the final plan before human approval.

Output: Production-ready Python course with consistent voice, integrated Git/tools content, and smooth difficulty progression.

## Git/Tools Module Scope (from 07-CONTEXT.md)

- Coverage: Full developer workflow including Git, Python tooling (venv, pip), editor setup, and potentially CI/CD basics
- Placement: Spread throughout the course at optimal points — OpenCode to determine positioning (not all in one place)
- Git depth: Progressive introduction — basics early, advanced topics introduced when contextually relevant
- Lesson format: OpenCode decides per lesson whether challenges or quizzes are more appropriate

## Prior Phase Final Pass Patterns

From STATE.md final plans:
- Phase 2 (02-08): Global verification and voice pass — sweep for survivors, progression review, human checkpoint
- Phase 3 (03-07): Global verification and voice pass — zero systemic issues found
- Phase 4 (04-05): KEY_POINT enrichment + global sweep — human approved
- Phase 5 (05-07): Global verification and sweep — human approved
- Phase 6 (06-10): Global verification and sweep — human approved

All prior phases ended with a human checkpoint for voice and progression approval.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Integrate Git and developer tools content</name>
  <files>content/courses/python/modules/*/lessons/*/content/*.md (selected lessons for Git integration)</files>
  <action>
    Integrate Git and developer tools content throughout the course at optimal points:
    
    Early course (M01-03): Git basics
    - M01 or M02: Add Git initialization concept ("As you write code, you'll want to track changes...")
    - Introduce git init, git add, git commit in context of first Python files
    - Keep it light - just the concept that version control exists
    
    Mid course (M09-10): File I/O and Modules
    - M09 (File I/O): Add .gitignore discussion when talking about file handling
    - M10 (Modules): Add virtual environment (venv) introduction
    - Introduce pip install and requirements.txt concept
    
    Late course (M14+): Professional workflows
    - M14+ (Web frameworks): Add more comprehensive Git workflows (branching, merging)
    - M17 (Sharing Your Work): Should already cover packaging - enhance with CI/CD basics if not present
    - M20 (Testing): Add Git hooks for pre-commit testing if not present
    
    Implementation approach:
    1. Review existing lessons in these modules for natural integration points
    2. Add Git/tools content as:
       - New content sections within existing lessons (preferred)
       - Standalone lessons if the concept warrants it
    3. Ensure progression: early = concepts, mid = practical usage, late = professional workflows
    
    Content to add:
    - Git: init, add, commit, status, log, branch, merge, .gitignore
    - Python tools: venv, pip, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml
    - Editor: VS Code or similar setup (if not already covered)
    - CI/CD: GitHub Actions basics (in M17 or M20)

  </verify>
  <done>
    - Git basics integrated in early modules (M01-03)
    - venv and pip introduced in mid modules (M09-10)
    - Professional Git workflows in late modules (M14+)
    - Content feels natural, not forced

  <files>content/courses/python/modules/0[1-8]-*/lessons/*/content/theory.md, content/courses/python/modules/0[1-8]-*/lessons/*/content/example.md</files>
  <action>
    Perform voice consistency pass on beginner modules (M01-08):
    
    Voice characteristics for beginner content:
    - Encouraging and supportive tone
    - Short, clear sentences
    - Frequent analogies and real-world connections
    - "You" language ("You'll learn...", "You can...")
    - Minimal jargon, or jargon immediately explained
    - Celebratory language for milestones ("Great job!", "You've mastered...")
    
    Check for and fix:
    1. Inconsistent pronouns (switching between "you", "we", "the student")
    2. Sudden difficulty spikes (complex concepts without proper scaffolding)
    3. Missing encouragement at concept milestones
    4. Inconsistent code comment style
    5. Mixed British/American spelling (standardize on American English)
    
    Sample lessons to review (spot-check approach):
    - M01 L01 (first lesson - sets the tone)
    - M03 (middle of fundamentals)
    - M05 (data structures)
    - M08 (end of fundamentals - exception handling)

    - More technical depth, but still explained clearly
    - "You" language with more technical confidence
    - Real-world application focus
    - Problem-solution framing
    
    Check for and fix:
    1. Inconsistent technical depth (some lessons too shallow, others too deep)
    2. Missing connections to prior learning ("Remember from Module X...")
    3. Abrupt topic transitions
    4. Inconsistent framework naming (FastAPI vs fastapi, etc.)
    5. Code style consistency (PEP 8 adherence)
    
    Sample lessons to review:
    - M10 (modules - transition to professional code)
    - M12 (decorators - advanced patterns)

  <name>Task 5: Human verification - Voice and progression review</name>
  <what-built>
    Complete Python course audit with:
    - All 24 modules reviewed for Python 3.12+ accuracy
    - Bridge lessons at major transitions (M13→M14, M16→M21)
    - Git and developer tools integrated throughout
    - All challenges validated and fixed
    - Voice consistency pass across all difficulty levels
    - Capstone project complete and deployable

  <how-to-verify>
    1. Review sample lessons from each difficulty level:
       - Beginner: M01 L01 (first lesson - tone check)
       - Beginner: M05 (data structures - complexity check)
       - Intermediate: M11 (OOP - technical depth check)
       - Intermediate: M14 (FastAPI - framework introduction check)
       - Advanced: M19 (exception groups - advanced concept check)
       - Advanced: M24 (capstone - culmination check)
    
    2. Check voice consistency:
       - Does the voice feel consistent across samples?
       - Is the difficulty progression smooth?
       - Are there any jarring tone shifts?
    
    3. Verify Git/tools integration:
       - Is Git content naturally integrated?
       - Does the progression (basics → workflows) make sense?
    
    4. Check capstone:
       - Are instructions clear?
       - Can you follow the deployment path?
    
    5. Overall assessment:
       - Is the course production-ready?
       - Would you be comfortable publishing this?
