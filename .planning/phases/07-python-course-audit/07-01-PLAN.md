<objective>
Perform comprehensive structural review of the Python course to understand the current state, verify module progression, identify bridge lesson needs, and catalog any structural issues before content accuracy work begins.

Purpose: Establish a complete map of the Python course structure so subsequent accuracy and validation work can proceed efficiently. This plan follows the pattern established in Phases 2-6 (Java, JavaScript, C#, Flutter, Kotlin audits).

Output: Updated course metadata (if needed), structural analysis report, and catalog of bridge lesson opportunities.

## Prior Phase Patterns (from STATE.md)

Following patterns from Phases 2-6:
- Phase 2 (Java): Started with structural review (02-01), identified module overlaps, version targets
- Phase 3 (JavaScript): Structural review (03-02) identified prerequisite chains, lesson swaps needed
- Phase 4 (C#): Structural review (04-01) identified module title issues, content overlaps
- Phase 5 (Flutter): Structural review (05-01) fixed generic module titles, renamed experiment files
- Phase 6 (Kotlin): Structural review (06-01) fixed lesson ordering, removed module title prefixes

## Python Course Context

From 07-CONTEXT.md:
- Module 14 was already restructured in Phase 1 (split into modules 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 22, 23)
- Bridge lessons needed at all major framework transitions
- Git/tools content to be spread throughout course at optimal points
- Challenge validation requires 100% solution execution verification

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Verify version targets and course metadata</name>
  <files>content/courses/python/course.json, content/version-manifest.json</files>
  <action>
    1. Read content/courses/python/course.json and verify:
       - minimumRuntimeVersion is "Python 3.12" or higher
       - estimatedHours is reasonable for ~171 lessons (compare to other courses)
       - difficulty is appropriate (should likely be "beginner-to-advanced" like other audited courses)
       - description mentions correct Python version
    
    2. Read content/version-manifest.json and verify Python section:
       - runtime.version is "3.12" or higher
       - All framework versions are current and accurate
       - Notes field correctly describes version policy
    
    3. Update course.json if needed:
       - If difficulty is "beginner", change to "beginner-to-advanced" (pattern from Phases 2-6)
       - If estimatedHours seems low for 171 lessons, update to more realistic value
       - Ensure minimumRuntimeVersion is present and correct
    
    4. Document any version discrepancies found for later plans.
  </action>
  <verify>
    cat content/courses/python/course.json | grep -E "(minimumRuntimeVersion|estimatedHours|difficulty)"
    cat content/version-manifest.json | grep -A10 '"python"'
  </verify>
  <done>
    - course.json has correct minimumRuntimeVersion (Python 3.12+)
    - course.json has appropriate estimatedHours and difficulty
    - version-manifest.json Python section is accurate
    - Any version issues are documented
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Analyze module structure and progression</name>
  <files>content/courses/python/modules/*/module.json</files>
  <action>
    1. Read all 24 module.json files and build a structural overview:
       - Module order (should be sequential 1-24)
       - Module titles and descriptions
       - Difficulty progression (beginner → intermediate → advanced)
       - Estimated hours per module
       - Any generic or misleading titles (like C# M06 "Methods and Functions" that was actually OOP basics)
    
    2. Identify potential progression issues:
       - Modules with duplicate or overlapping content
       - Difficulty jumps (beginner → advanced with no intermediate)
       - Prerequisites not met by prior modules
       - Framework transitions without bridge content
    
    3. Catalog the following for subsequent plans:
       - Bridge lesson opportunities at major transitions:
         * M06 (functions) → M07 (dictionaries) - data structures transition
         * M09 (file I/O) → M10 (modules/packages) - project structure transition
         * M11 (OOP) → M12 (decorators) - advanced patterns transition
         * M13 (async) → M14 (FastAPI) - web framework transition
         * M14-16 (API) → M21 (Django) - framework comparison/transition
       - Modules with suspiciously low or high estimatedHours
       - Any module titles that don't match content descriptions
    
    4. Calculate total estimatedHours from modules and compare to course.json.
  </action>
  <verify>
    # Verify all 24 modules exist with correct ordering
    ls content/courses/python/modules/ | sort -V
    
    # Check for any modules with generic titles
    grep -r "title" content/courses/python/modules/*/module.json | grep -i "module \|lesson \|part "
  </verify>
  <done>
    - All 24 modules have sequential ordering (1-24)
    - Module progression analysis complete with no critical blockers
    - Bridge lesson opportunities catalogued at major transitions
    - Any structural issues documented for subsequent plans
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Analyze lesson structure and identify gaps</name>
  <files>content/courses/python/modules/*/lessons/*/lesson.json</files>
  <action>
    1. Count total lessons across all modules (expect ~171 based on roadmap)
    2. For each module, analyze lesson structure:
       - Lesson count per module
       - Consistent ID format (module-XX-lesson-YY)
       - Prerequisite chains (lessons referencing prior lessons)
       - Content section types used (THEORY, EXAMPLE, KEY_POINT, ANALOGY, WARNING, LEGACY_COMPARISON)
    
    3. Identify content gaps (following patterns from Phases 2-6):
       - Lessons missing KEY_POINT sections (systemic gap indicator)
       - Lessons missing ANALOGY sections (especially complex topics)
       - Lessons missing WARNING sections (especially advanced/error-prone topics)
       - Non-standard content types that should have been migrated in Phase 1
    
    4. Catalog challenge coverage:
       - Which lessons have challenges vs. which don't
       - Challenge type distribution (FREE_CODING, QUIZ, MULTI_CHOICE)
       - Any lessons that should have challenges but don't
    
    5. Document findings for subsequent plans:
       - Modules with low content type coverage (for enrichment pass)
       - Lessons that may need bridge content
       - Any structural anomalies found
  </action>
  <verify>
    # Count total lessons
    find content/courses/python/modules -name "lesson.json" | wc -l
    
    # Check for non-standard content types (should all be standard after Phase 1)
    find content/courses/python/modules -name "*.json" -path "*/content/*" -exec grep -l "type.*:.*CODE\|type.*:.*CONCEPT\|type.*:.*ARCHITECTURE" {} \;
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Total lesson count verified (~171 lessons)
    - Content type gaps catalogued (KEY_POINT, ANALOGY, WARNING coverage)
    - Challenge coverage analyzed per module
    - Structural anomalies documented for subsequent plans
  </done>
</task>
