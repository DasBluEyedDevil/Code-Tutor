<objective>
Add KEY_POINT content files to 44 lessons missing them and add WARNING files to Modules 11-14 (which have zero WARNING content). Bring Flutter course enrichment to parity with audited Java/JS/C# courses.

Purpose: KEY_POINTs provide students with clear takeaways per lesson. WARNINGs highlight common mistakes. The C# audit added 131 KEY_POINTs in a single plan -- this is the Flutter equivalent for the 44 gaps identified in research.
Output: 44 new KEY_POINT files, ~15-20 new WARNING files for M11-M14.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add KEY_POINT files to 44 lessons missing them</name>
  <files>
    44 new *-key_point.md files across content/courses/flutter/modules/
  </files>
  <action>
    First, identify all 44 lessons that lack KEY_POINT content. The research identified these modules as having gaps:
    - M05 (User Interaction): 0/5 lessons have KEY_POINTs
    - M12 (Real-Time): 0/6 lessons
    - M13 (Offline-First): 0/7 lessons
    - M18 (Capstone): 6/12 lessons (6 missing)
    - Scattered gaps in other modules totaling 44

    For completeness, scan ALL 153 lessons: list content files per lesson, check for *key_point* files.
    SKIP archived lessons (M09 L10-L17, L19) -- do NOT create KEY_POINTs for archived content.

    For each lesson missing a KEY_POINT, create a new file:
    - Filename: `{next_number}-key_point.md` where next_number follows the highest existing content file number + 1
    - Frontmatter:
      ```
      ---
      type: KEY_POINT
      ---
      ```
    - Content: 3-5 bullet points summarizing the key takeaways from the lesson
    - Each bullet should be concise (1-2 sentences), actionable, and specific to the lesson topic
    - Read the lesson's existing content (THEORY, EXAMPLE files) to derive accurate KEY_POINTs
    - Pattern follows the C# course KEY_POINT style (see 04-05-SUMMARY for reference)

    **KEY_POINT quality rules:**
    - Specific to the lesson, not generic programming advice
    - Actionable -- student knows what to DO, not just what to KNOW
    - Accurate against Flutter 3.38/Dart 3.10 (post-accuracy-pass content)
    - 3-5 bullets per file (not a wall of text)
    - Each bullet starts with a concept or action, not "Remember that..." or "Note that..."

    **Example for a Riverpod lesson:**
    ```
    - `ref.watch()` rebuilds the widget when the provider value changes; use it in `build()` methods only
    - `ref.read()` reads the current value without subscribing to changes; use it in callbacks and event handlers
    - `ConsumerWidget` replaces `StatelessWidget` when you need access to Riverpod providers
    - Provider disposal is automatic for `autoDispose` providers when no widget is listening
    ```
  </action>
  <verify>
    Count new KEY_POINT files created (target: 44).
    Verify every active lesson (excluding 14 archived/misplaced) has at least one KEY_POINT file.
    Spot-check 5 KEY_POINT files for quality (specific, actionable, accurate).
    Verify all frontmatter has `type: KEY_POINT`.
  </verify>
  <done>
    44 new KEY_POINT files created. Every active Flutter lesson now has at least one KEY_POINT content section. All frontmatter correct.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add WARNING files to M11-M14 (zero-WARNING modules)</name>
  <files>
    New *-warning.md files in:
    content/courses/flutter/modules/11-api-integration-and-auth-flows/lessons/*/content/
    content/courses/flutter/modules/12-real-time-features/lessons/*/content/
    content/courses/flutter/modules/13-offline-first-and-persistence/lessons/*/content/
    content/courses/flutter/modules/14-frontend-testing/lessons/*/content/
  </files>
  <action>
    Research identified M11, M12, M13, M14 as having ZERO warning content. These are modules with genuine pitfalls that students should be warned about.

    For each module, identify lessons where WARNINGs are natural (not every lesson needs one -- only where genuine pitfalls exist):

    **M11 API Integration & Auth (for active lessons L01-L08 only):**
    - HTTP errors: Always handle non-200 responses; don't assume API calls succeed
    - JSON serialization: Type mismatches at runtime if model doesn't match API response
    - Token storage: NEVER store tokens in SharedPreferences; use flutter_secure_storage
    - OAuth: Redirect URIs must match exactly or auth will silently fail
    - Auth state: Token expiration must be handled; refresh token rotation
    Target: ~4-5 WARNING files

    **M12 Real-Time Features:**
    - WebSocket connections: Must handle reconnection logic; connections drop silently
    - Memory leaks: StreamSubscription must be cancelled in dispose()
    - Message ordering: Network latency can cause out-of-order messages
    Target: ~3-4 WARNING files

    **M13 Offline-First & Persistence:**
    - Drift migrations: Schema changes require explicit migration steps or data loss
    - Sync conflicts: Offline edits may conflict with server state; needs resolution strategy
    - Storage limits: Mobile devices have limited storage; implement cleanup
    Target: ~3-4 WARNING files

    **M14 Frontend Testing:**
    - Widget tests: pumpAndSettle() can hang on animations that never complete; use pump() with duration
    - Golden tests: Platform-specific rendering differences cause CI failures
    - Integration tests: Require a real device or emulator; cannot run in headless CI without setup
    Target: ~3-4 WARNING files

    For each WARNING file:
    - Filename: `{next_number}-warning.md` following highest existing content file number + 1
    - Frontmatter: `type: WARNING`
    - Content: Clear description of the pitfall, why it happens, and how to avoid it
    - 2-4 paragraphs or a short paragraph + code example showing the mistake and fix
    - Only create WARNINGs for genuine, common pitfalls -- do NOT invent edge-case warnings

    SKIP misplaced lessons (M10 L06-L08, M11 L09-L10) -- no WARNINGs for misplaced content.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Count new WARNING files created (target: ~13-17 across M11-M14).
    Verify each WARNING is for a genuine pitfall (not padding).
    Verify all frontmatter has `type: WARNING`.
    Verify no WARNING files created for archived or misplaced lessons.
  </verify>
  <done>
    ~15 new WARNING files created across M11-M14. All four previously zero-WARNING modules now have appropriate cautionary content. Only genuine pitfalls covered.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Every active Flutter lesson has at least one KEY_POINT file
2. M11, M12, M13, M14 each have at least 3 WARNING files
3. All new files have correct frontmatter (type: KEY_POINT or type: WARNING)
4. No KEY_POINT or WARNING files created for archived/misplaced lessons
5. Content quality: specific, actionable, accurate
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- 44 new KEY_POINT files bring coverage to 100% of active lessons
- ~15 new WARNING files close the M11-M14 gap
- All content is lesson-specific and technically accurate
- Frontmatter consistent with standard content types
</success_criteria>
