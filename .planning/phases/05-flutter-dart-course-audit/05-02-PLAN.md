<objective>
Verify accuracy of Modules 01-07 (53 lessons, ~350 content files) against Flutter 3.38/Dart 3.10 stable. Fix version references, verify widget patterns, confirm Riverpod 2.x patterns with migration note, update GoRouter to 17.x references.

Purpose: These are the foundational modules (Dart basics, widgets, layouts, interaction, state management, navigation). Students encounter them first -- accuracy here prevents cascading confusion in later modules.
Output: All M01-M07 content verified accurate against Flutter 3.38/Dart 3.10, with corrections applied.

  </files>
  <action>
    Read ALL content files for M01-M05 (34 lessons, ~220 files). For each lesson, verify:

    **M01 Flutter Setup (5 lessons):**
    - SDK installation instructions reference Flutter 3.38/Dart 3.10 (the setup content already mentions 3.38+, verify consistency)
    - VS Code extension names are current (Flutter, Dart extensions)
    - Emulator/device setup instructions are current
    - Any Flutter CLI commands use current syntax (`flutter create`, `flutter run`, `flutter doctor`)
    - Fix any references to Flutter 3.27 that should now be 3.38

    **M02 Dart Programming Basics (8 lessons):**
    - Variables, types, functions, control flow verified against Dart 3.10
    - L08 "Dart 3 Modern Features" -- verify records, patterns, sealed classes are accurately described (these are Dart 3.0+ features, stable and unchanged through 3.10)
    - Null safety described correctly (sound null safety since Dart 3.0)
    - Collection literals, string interpolation, cascade notation all current
    - sdk constraint in any pubspec examples should be '>=3.10.0 <4.0.0'

    **M03 Flutter Widget Fundamentals (8 lessons):**
    - StatelessWidget, Text, Image, Container, Column, Row patterns are stable and should be correct
    - Verify no deprecated widget constructors (e.g., FlatButton -> TextButton, RaisedButton -> ElevatedButton -- these were deprecated in Flutter 2.0, should already be correct)
    - Material 3 is default since Flutter 3.16 -- verify ThemeData uses Material 3 patterns (useMaterial3: true is now default)
    - Mention dot shorthands (Dart 3.10) where relevant: MainAxisAlignment.center can be written as .center

    **M04 Layouts and Scrolling (8 lessons):**
    - ListView, GridView, Stack, SliverAppBar patterns verified
    - Responsive layout patterns (LayoutBuilder, MediaQuery) current
    - Material 3 theming lesson verified (M04 L07)
    - Expanded, Flexible, SizedBox all current API

    **M05 User Interaction (5 lessons):**
    - Button types (ElevatedButton, TextButton, OutlinedButton, IconButton) current
    - Form validation patterns current (Form, TextFormField, GlobalKey<FormState>)
    - GestureDetector, InkWell patterns current
    - StatefulWidget lifecycle accurate (initState, dispose, setState)

    **What to fix:**
    - Any Flutter version references that say 3.27 when content should say 3.38
    - Any Dart SDK constraints that say >=3.0.0 or >=3.6.0, update to >=3.10.0
    - Any deprecated widget usage (unlikely but check)
    - Any pubspec.yaml examples with outdated SDK constraints
    - Remove any version-tagged framing ("Since Flutter 3.x..." -- just state the feature)

    **What NOT to fix:**
    - Do NOT add missing KEY_POINTs (separate plan)
    - Do NOT add missing ANALOGYs (separate plan)
    - Do NOT modify challenge files (separate plan)
    - Do NOT restructure lessons

  <action>
    Read ALL content files for M06-M07 (19 lessons, ~130 files). These are the most version-sensitive modules in the fundamentals section.

    **M06 MVVM Architecture with Riverpod (10 lessons):**
    - Verify all Riverpod patterns are correct for 2.x API:
      - Provider, StateProvider, StateNotifierProvider, NotifierProvider, AsyncNotifierProvider
      - Notifier<T>, AsyncNotifier<T> class patterns
      - ref.watch(), ref.read(), ref.listen() usage
      - ConsumerWidget, ConsumerStatefulWidget
      - riverpod_generator / @riverpod annotation patterns
    - Version constraint references: flutter_riverpod should say ^2.6.1 (latest 2.x) NOT ^2.4.0
    - riverpod_annotation, riverpod_generator, build_runner versions should be current 2.x
    - DO NOT upgrade to Riverpod 3.x patterns. Keep 2.x.
    - ADD a brief note (1-2 paragraphs, as a WARNING or inline note) in the first Riverpod lesson (M06 L01 or wherever Riverpod is introduced) stating:
      "Riverpod 3.x was released in September 2025 with unified Ref and other changes. This course teaches Riverpod 2.x Notifier patterns, which remain fully functional in Riverpod 3.x via legacy imports. A migration guide is available at riverpod.dev/docs/3.0_migration."
    - Verify MVVM architecture explanation is accurate (Model-View-ViewModel with Riverpod as the ViewModel layer)
    - hooks_riverpod version should be ^2.6.1 (or latest 2.x)

    **M07 Navigation and Routing (9 lessons):**
    - GoRouter version references: update any ^14.0.0 to ^17.0.0
    - Verify GoRouter API usage is correct for 17.x:
      - GoRouter() constructor, GoRoute, ShellRoute patterns
      - context.go(), context.push(), context.pop()
      - Redirect logic, guards
      - Deep linking configuration
    - GoRouter 17.x requires Flutter 3.32+/Dart 3.8+ minimum -- verify this is noted
    - PopScope widget (not WillPopScope) -- verify course uses PopScope correctly
    - Bottom navigation bar integration with GoRouter (StatefulShellRoute)
    - Tab bar navigation patterns
    - Drawer navigation patterns
    - If any lesson references "Current version: 17.0.0", update to "17.x" (avoid pinning patch version)

    **What to fix:**
    - Outdated Riverpod version constraints (^2.4.0 -> ^2.6.1)
    - Outdated GoRouter version constraints (^14.0.0 -> ^17.0.0)
    - Any deprecated Riverpod patterns (StateNotifierProvider is deprecated in favor of NotifierProvider -- check if course still teaches it)
    - Any WillPopScope references (should be PopScope)

    **What NOT to fix:**
    - Do NOT migrate to Riverpod 3.x unified Ref
    - Do NOT add KEY_POINTs or ANALOGYs (separate plan)
    - Do NOT modify challenges (separate plan)

  <verify>
    Grep for "^14.0.0" or "go_router.*14" in M07 content -- should be zero.
    Grep for "^2.4.0" in M06 riverpod references -- should be updated.
    Grep for "WillPopScope" in M07 -- should be zero.
    Verify Riverpod migration note exists in M06 L01 or appropriate lesson.
