<objective>
Verify accuracy of Modules 01-07 (53 lessons, ~350 content files) against Flutter 3.38/Dart 3.10 stable. Fix version references, verify widget patterns, confirm Riverpod 2.x patterns with migration note, update GoRouter to 17.x references.

Purpose: These are the foundational modules (Dart basics, widgets, layouts, interaction, state management, navigation). Students encounter them first -- accuracy here prevents cascading confusion in later modules.
Output: All M01-M07 content verified accurate against Flutter 3.38/Dart 3.10, with corrections applied.

    **Scope management (IMPORTANT -- context budget):**
    M01-M05 covers 34 lessons with ~220 content files. Do NOT exhaustively read every file front-to-back.
    Instead, use a targeted approach:
    1. Grep across all M01-M05 content for stale version strings: "Flutter 3.27", "Dart 3.6", ">=3.0.0", ">=3.6.0", "FlatButton", "RaisedButton", "WillPopScope", "useMaterial3: true" (verify if set explicitly when it's now default)
    2. Read only files that match stale patterns, plus a spot-check of 2-3 representative files per module
    3. For M02 L08 (Dart 3 features), read fully to verify records/patterns/sealed accuracy
    4. Fix matched files; skip files with no version issues

    **M01 Flutter Setup (5 lessons):**
    - SDK installation instructions reference Flutter 3.38/Dart 3.10 (the setup content already mentions 3.38+, verify consistency)
    - VS Code extension names are current (Flutter, Dart extensions)
    - Any Flutter CLI commands use current syntax (`flutter create`, `flutter run`, `flutter doctor`)
    - Fix any references to Flutter 3.27 that should now be 3.38

    **M02 Dart Programming Basics (8 lessons):**
    - L08 "Dart 3 Modern Features" -- verify records, patterns, sealed classes are accurately described
    - Null safety described correctly (sound null safety since Dart 3.0)
    - sdk constraint in any pubspec examples should be '>=3.10.0 <4.0.0'

    **M03 Flutter Widget Fundamentals (8 lessons):**
    - Verify no deprecated widget constructors
    - Material 3 is default since Flutter 3.16 -- verify ThemeData uses Material 3 patterns
    - Mention dot shorthands (Dart 3.10) where relevant: MainAxisAlignment.center can be written as .center

    **M04 Layouts and Scrolling (8 lessons):**
    - ListView, GridView, Stack, SliverAppBar patterns verified via spot-check
    - Material 3 theming lesson verified (M04 L07)

    **M05 User Interaction (5 lessons):**
    - Button types (ElevatedButton, TextButton, OutlinedButton, IconButton) current
    - Form validation patterns current

    **What to fix:**
    - Any Flutter version references that say 3.27 when content should say 3.38
    - Any Dart SDK constraints that say >=3.0.0 or >=3.6.0, update to >=3.10.0
    - Any deprecated widget usage (unlikely but check)
    - Any pubspec.yaml examples with outdated SDK constraints
    - Remove any version-tagged framing ("Since Flutter 3.x..." -- just state the feature)

    **What NOT to fix:**
    - Do NOT add missing KEY_POINTs (separate plan)
    - Do NOT add missing ANALOGYs (separate plan)
    - Do NOT modify challenge files (separate plan)
    - Do NOT restructure lessons

    Grep for "Dart 3.6" in M01-M05 content -- should be zero (unless in historical context).
    Grep for deprecated widgets: "FlatButton|RaisedButton" -- should be zero.
    Count files modified and corrections made.

    **Scope management (IMPORTANT -- context budget):**
    M06-M07 covers 19 lessons with ~130 content files. These are the most version-sensitive modules.
    Use a targeted approach:
    1. Grep across all M06-M07 content for: "^2.4.0", "^2.5.0", "^14.0.0", "WillPopScope", "StateNotifierProvider" (deprecated), "go_router.*14"
    2. Read files with version-sensitive content (pubspec examples, import statements, provider declarations)
    3. For M06 L01 (Riverpod intro), read fully to add the Riverpod 3.x migration note
    4. For M07 GoRouter lessons, focus on version constraint strings and API patterns

    **M06 MVVM Architecture with Riverpod (10 lessons):**
    - Verify all Riverpod patterns are correct for 2.x API:
      - Provider, StateProvider, StateNotifierProvider, NotifierProvider, AsyncNotifierProvider
      - Notifier<T>, AsyncNotifier<T> class patterns
      - ref.watch(), ref.read(), ref.listen() usage
      - ConsumerWidget, ConsumerStatefulWidget
      - riverpod_generator / @riverpod annotation patterns
    - Version constraint references: flutter_riverpod should say ^2.6.1 (latest 2.x) NOT ^2.4.0
    - riverpod_annotation, riverpod_generator, build_runner versions should be current 2.x
    - DO NOT upgrade to Riverpod 3.x patterns. Keep 2.x.
    - ADD a brief note (1-2 paragraphs, as a WARNING or inline note) in the first Riverpod lesson (M06 L01 or wherever Riverpod is introduced) stating:
      "Riverpod 3.x was released in September 2025 with unified Ref and other changes. This course teaches Riverpod 2.x Notifier patterns, which remain fully functional in Riverpod 3.x via legacy imports. A migration guide is available at riverpod.dev/docs/3.0_migration."
    - Verify MVVM architecture explanation is accurate (Model-View-ViewModel with Riverpod as the ViewModel layer)

    **M07 Navigation and Routing (9 lessons):**
    - GoRouter version references: update any ^14.0.0 to ^17.0.0
    - Verify GoRouter API usage is correct for 17.x:
      - GoRouter() constructor, GoRoute, ShellRoute patterns
      - context.go(), context.push(), context.pop()
      - Redirect logic, guards
      - Deep linking configuration
    - GoRouter 17.x requires Flutter 3.32+/Dart 3.8+ minimum -- verify this is noted
    - PopScope widget (not WillPopScope) -- verify course uses PopScope correctly
    - If any lesson references "Current version: 17.0.0", update to "17.x" (avoid pinning patch version)

    **What to fix:**
    - Outdated Riverpod version constraints (^2.4.0 -> ^2.6.1)
    - Outdated GoRouter version constraints (^14.0.0 -> ^17.0.0)
    - Any deprecated Riverpod patterns (StateNotifierProvider is deprecated in favor of NotifierProvider -- check if course still teaches it)
    - Any WillPopScope references (should be PopScope)

    **What NOT to fix:**
    - Do NOT migrate to Riverpod 3.x unified Ref
    - Do NOT add KEY_POINTs or ANALOGYs (separate plan)
    - Do NOT modify challenges (separate plan)
