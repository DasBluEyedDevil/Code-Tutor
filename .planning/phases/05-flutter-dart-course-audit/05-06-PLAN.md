<objective>
Validate all 217 challenges (execute pure Dart M01-M07, code-review M08-M18), add ANALOGY content to the worst-gap modules, and verify capstone completeness for FLTR-04.

Purpose: FLTR-03 requires all coding challenges to execute and validate correctly. FLTR-04 requires a deployable capstone. The massive ANALOGY gap (11 modules with zero analogies) needs partial closure.
Output: Challenge validation report, ~30 new ANALOGY files for worst-gap modules, capstone assessment.

    **Phase A: Inventory all challenges**
    Scan all 18 modules and build a challenge inventory:
    - Total challenges per module
    - Which have solution.dart (173 of 217 per research)
    - Which have starter.dart (184 per research)
    - Which are missing solutions (44 challenges)
    Skip challenges in archived lessons (M09 L10-L17, L19 -- these have no challenges anyway per research).

    **Phase B: Validate ALL pure Dart challenges (M01-M07, ~80 challenges)**
    FLTR-03 requires challenge validation. For pure Dart challenges (no Flutter imports, no package dependencies), validate ALL of them -- not a sample:

    1. **Syntactic validation (ALL ~80 challenges):** Read each solution.dart and verify it is syntactically correct Dart 3.10 code. Check for:
       - Correct use of Dart 3.x features (records, patterns, sealed classes where used)
       - No Dart 2.x patterns that would fail on Dart 3.10 (unlikely but check)
       - Solution matches challenge.json requirements (description, expected behavior)
       - Solution uses patterns taught in the lesson (not advanced patterns from later modules)

    2. **Compilation verification (ALL compilable challenges):** If Dart SDK is available locally, run `dart analyze` or `dart compile` on each pure Dart solution.dart to verify it compiles. For solutions that are standalone (have a `main()` function), also attempt `dart run`. If Dart SDK is not available, document this and rely on syntactic review only.

    3. **M02 L08 special case:** Dart 3 Modern Features challenges use records, patterns, sealed classes. These are valid Dart 3.x but WILL NOT work on Piston (Dart 2.19.6). Validate they compile locally. Document the Piston limitation.

    **Phase C: Code-review backend/framework challenges (M08-M18, ~137 challenges)**
    These challenges CANNOT be executed (require project context, dependencies, database). For each:
    - Read solution.dart and verify it matches the patterns taught in the module
    - Verify any Riverpod code uses 2.x Notifier patterns (matching M06 accuracy pass)
    - Verify any GoRouter code uses 17.x patterns (matching M07 accuracy pass)
    - Verify any Serverpod code uses 2.x patterns (matching M09 accuracy pass)
    - Verify any Dart Frog code uses current RequestContext/Response patterns
    - Check challenge.json for accuracy (description, difficulty, type)
    - Fix any solution.dart files that use patterns inconsistent with the accuracy passes

    **Phase D: Document missing solutions**
    For the 44 challenges missing solution.dart:
    - If the challenge is in an archived/misplaced lesson, skip it
    - For active challenges missing solutions:
      - If the challenge is simple enough, create the solution.dart
      - If the challenge requires complex project context, document it as "code-review-only"
    - Target: Reduce missing solutions where feasible

    **Piston limitation documentation:**
    Add a note to the summary (NOT to content files) about the Piston Dart 2.19.6 limitation:
    - Only M01-M07 pure Dart challenges can execute via Piston (if Piston is updated to Dart 3.x)
    - Currently, Piston uses Dart 2.19.6 which cannot run ANY Dart 3 features
    - Local `dart run` works for all pure Dart challenges with current SDK
    - Backend challenges require project context and cannot execute in either path
  </action>
  <verify>
    Report total challenges validated: X syntactically validated + Y compiled/executed + Z code-reviewed.
    Confirm ALL ~80 pure Dart challenges were syntactically validated (not just a sample).
    Report challenges with missing solutions: before (44) and after.
    Report challenges with fixes applied.
    Verify no Riverpod 3.x patterns in challenge solutions.
    Verify no GoRouter ^14.0.0 patterns in challenge solutions.
  </verify>
  <done>
    All ~80 pure Dart challenges (M01-M07) syntactically validated against Dart 3.10 (with compilation where Dart SDK available). All ~137 backend challenges (M08-M18) code-reviewed for framework pattern consistency. Missing solutions reduced where feasible. Piston limitation documented.

  <name>Task 2: ANALOGY enrichment for worst-gap modules + capstone assessment</name>
  <files>
    New *-analogy.md files in content/courses/flutter/modules/08-* through 18-*/lessons/*/content/
  </files>
  <action>
    **ANALOGY enrichment:**
    Research identified that modules 08, 10-18 have ZERO analogies (11 modules, ~90 active lessons). Adding analogies to ALL 90 lessons would be enormous and is not realistic in this phase.

    Priority approach: Add analogies to INTRODUCTORY lessons (L01) of each zero-analogy module, plus key concept lessons. Target: ~25-30 new analogy files across the 11 gap modules.

    Per module targets:
    - M08 (Dart Frog): L01 intro + L04 middleware -- 2 files
    - M10 (Backend Testing): L01 testing philosophy -- 1 file
    - M11 (API Integration): L01 connecting Flutter + L04 auth registration -- 2 files
    - M12 (Real-Time): L01 intro to WebSockets + L02 chat -- 2 files
    - M13 (Offline-First): L01 intro + L02 Drift -- 2 files
    - M14 (Frontend Testing): L01 intro + L03 golden testing -- 2 files
    - M15 (Advanced UI): L01 animations + L05 accessibility -- 2 files
    - M16 (Deployment): L01 intro + L03 app signing -- 2 files
    - M17 (Production Ops): L01 crash reporting + L04 feature flags -- 2 files
    - M18 (Capstone): L01 project setup + L06 real-time messaging -- 2 files

    That's ~21 new ANALOGY files. If time allows, add more to critical concept lessons.

    For each ANALOGY file:
    - Filename: `{next_number}-analogy.md` following highest existing content file number + 1
    - Frontmatter: `type: ANALOGY`
    - Content: A real-world analogy that makes the technical concept concrete
    - 1-3 paragraphs, comparing the technical concept to something physical/everyday
    - Follow the style of existing Flutter analogies in M01-M07 (read a few for reference)

    **Capstone assessment (FLTR-04):**
    Based on 05-04 accuracy pass findings, document capstone completeness:
    - Does M18 contain enough code/guidance to build the social chat app?
    - Is there a complete pubspec.yaml in the content?
    - Are all major features covered (auth, messaging, real-time, UI)?
    - What would a student need beyond the lesson content to deploy?
    - Document findings in the summary for FLTR-04 assessment
  </action>
  <verify>
    Count new ANALOGY files created (target: ~21-30).
    Verify each ANALOGY uses real-world comparison (not abstract).
    Verify all frontmatter has `type: ANALOGY`.
    Verify no analogies created for archived/misplaced lessons.
    Document FLTR-04 capstone assessment in summary.
  </verify>
  <done>
    ~25 new ANALOGY files added to worst-gap modules (M08, M10-M18). Each zero-analogy module now has at least 2 analogies. Capstone completeness assessed for FLTR-04. Remaining analogy gaps documented (full coverage would require future enrichment cycle).
  </done>
