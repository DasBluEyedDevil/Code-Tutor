<objective>
Verify accuracy of Modules 08-13 (~49 active lessons, ~320 content files) covering backend development, testing, API integration, real-time features, and offline persistence. Verify Dart Frog APIs against 1.2.x, document community maintenance status (FLTR-05). Verify Serverpod 2.x patterns with 3.x awareness. Skip archived/misplaced lessons.

Purpose: These modules cover the backend stack -- the most version-sensitive content in the Flutter course. Dart Frog community transition and Serverpod 3.0 release make accuracy critical here.
Output: Backend modules verified with Dart Frog community status documented and Serverpod 3.x migration warnings added.

    **M08 Dart Frog Backend Fundamentals (8 lessons) -- FLTR-05 focus:**
    Read ALL content files for M08. Verify against dart_frog 1.2.x:
    - `dart pub global activate dart_frog_cli` -- correct
    - `dart_frog create` -- correct
    - `dart_frog dev` -- correct
    - File-based routing (routes/ directory) -- correct
    - RequestContext, Response API -- correct
    - Middleware via _middleware.dart -- correct
    - JWT authentication patterns -- verify correct
    - Database integration patterns -- verify correct

    ADD to M08 L01 (or whichever lesson introduces Dart Frog) a WARNING section or prominent note:
    "Dart Frog transitioned to community maintenance in July 2025. Previously maintained by Very Good Ventures (VGV), it is now under the dart-frog-dev GitHub organization. The core API is unchanged and the same maintainers continue contributing. All APIs taught in this module work with dart_frog 1.2.x. For the latest information, visit the community GitHub: github.com/dart-frog-dev."

    Update any dart_frog version constraints: ^1.0.0 -> ^1.2.0 (or keep ^1.0.0 since it's compatible)
    Verify dart_frog_cli version references if any (should be 1.2.x era)

    **M09 Serverpod Production Backend (active lessons only: L01-L09, L18):**
    SKIP lessons 10-17 (archived Firebase) and 19 (archived Supabase). These were annotated in 05-01.

    Read ALL content files for M09 active lessons. Verify against serverpod 2.x:
    - M09 L01 "Dart Frog vs Serverpod" comparison lesson:
      - Update comparison to note Serverpod 3.0 released Dec 2025 with new auth system (Relic) and new web server
      - Keep the "Swiss Army knife vs full workshop" analogy (still valid)
      - Add note: "This course teaches Serverpod 2.x patterns. Serverpod 3.0 (December 2025) introduced significant changes including a new authentication system (Relic) and web server. When starting new projects, check serverpod.dev for the latest version and migration guides."
    - M09 L02-L09: Verify Serverpod 2.x patterns:
      - serverpod create command and project structure
      - Model definitions and code generation
      - Endpoint patterns (extends Endpoint)
      - ORM queries (database operations)
      - Authentication module (2.x auth, note that 3.x Relic auth is different)
      - Real-time streams
      - File storage
      - Background tasks
    - ADD to M09 L02 (Serverpod Setup) a strong WARNING:
      "IMPORTANT: `dart pub global activate serverpod_cli` installs the latest CLI version (currently 3.x). This course teaches Serverpod 2.x patterns. To follow along exactly, pin the version: `dart pub global activate serverpod_cli ^2.0.0`. Serverpod 3.0 has breaking changes in authentication and web server components."
    - M09 L18 (Chat Backend mini-project): Verify against 2.x patterns, add same version pin note

    **Version constraint updates:**
    - serverpod: ^2.0.0 -- keep (do NOT update to ^3.0.0)
    - dart_frog: ^1.0.0 or ^1.2.0 -- either is fine
    - Any Flutter SDK constraints in pubspec examples should be >=3.10.0
  </action>
  <verify>
    Verify Dart Frog community status note exists in M08 L01.
    Verify Serverpod version pin warning exists in M09 L02.
    Verify Serverpod 3.x awareness note exists in M09 L01.
    Grep for any "Firebase" or "Supabase" references in M09 active lessons (L01-L09, L18) -- should only appear in comparison context.
    Count corrections made.

    M08 (8 lessons) Dart Frog content verified against 1.2.x with community status documented (FLTR-05). M09 (10 active lessons) Serverpod 2.x patterns verified with 3.x migration warnings and CLI version pin guidance. Archived lessons skipped.

    - Do NOT modify challenges (separate plan)
    - Do NOT audit misplaced or archived lessons

    Count total lessons audited (should be ~26 active lessons: 5 + 8 + 6 + 7).
