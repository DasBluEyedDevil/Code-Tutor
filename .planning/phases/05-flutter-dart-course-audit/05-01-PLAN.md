<objective>
Align the Flutter course to Flutter 3.38.x/Dart 3.10.x, fix 6 generic module titles, rename 18 non-standard experiment filenames to example, handle archived/misplaced lessons, and update course metadata.

Purpose: Establish correct version targets and clean structural foundation before content accuracy passes begin. Without this, accuracy passes would audit against the wrong version targets.
Output: Updated version-manifest.json, course.json, 6+ module.json files, 18 renamed content files, archived lessons annotated.

    Update version-manifest.json flutter section:
    - runtime.version: "3.27.x" -> "3.38.x"
    - secondaryRuntime.version: "3.6.x" -> "3.10.x"
    - runtime.notes: "Course targets Flutter 3.38/Dart 3.10. Dot shorthands (Dart 3.10) used in content. Impeller default on iOS and Android API 29+."
    - runtime.lastVerified: today's date
    - Riverpod: keep "2.x" but update notes: "State management. Course teaches Notifier/AsyncNotifier patterns (2.x API). These work in Riverpod 3.x via legacy imports. Riverpod 4.0 expected; migration deferred."
    - GoRouter: "14.x" -> "17.x", notes: "Declarative routing. Requires Flutter 3.32+/Dart 3.8+."
    - Dart Frog: keep "1.x", update notes: "Backend framework. Community-maintained since July 2025 (was VGV). API stable and unchanged (1.0.0 -> 1.2.6)."
    - Serverpod: keep "2.x", update notes: "Full-stack Dart server framework. Course teaches 2.x patterns. Serverpod 3.0 released Dec 2025 with new auth system (Relic) and web server; migration deferred to future cycle."
    - Add Drift framework entry: version "2.x", notes "Local SQLite database with type-safe queries. Compatible within 2.x line."
    - All framework lastVerified dates updated to today

    Update course.json:
    - minimumRuntimeVersion: "Flutter 3.27" -> "Flutter 3.38"
    - difficulty: "beginner" -> "beginner-to-advanced" (course covers Dart basics through production backends)
    - Verify estimatedHours (150) is reasonable for 153 lessons (keep if reasonable; prior courses: Java 96 lessons = 80h, C# 132 = 100h, JS 132 = 120h)
    - Update description to mention Flutter 3.38, Dart 3.10, 153 lessons, 18 modules

  <verify>
    Read version-manifest.json and verify Flutter section shows 3.38.x/3.10.x.
    Read course.json and verify minimumRuntimeVersion is "Flutter 3.38".
    Run the E2E validation tests if available: search for CourseContentValidationTests or similar test runner.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Version manifest targets Flutter 3.38.x/Dart 3.10.x with all framework notes updated. course.json reflects current targets and accurate metadata.

    18 experiment -> example renames across modules 02, 04, 07, 09, 10, 11
    lesson.json files for archived lessons in M09 (lessons 10-17, 19)

    **Fix 6 generic module titles** in module.json:
    - Module 01: "Module 0: Flutter Development" -> "Flutter Setup and Environment"
    - Module 02: "Module 1: Flutter Development" -> "Dart Programming Basics"
    - Module 03: "Module 2: Flutter Development" -> "Flutter Widget Fundamentals"
    - Module 04: "Module 3: Flutter Development" -> "Layouts and Scrolling"
    - Module 05: "Module 4: Flutter Development" -> "User Interaction"
    - Module 07: "Module 6: Flutter Development" -> "Navigation and Routing"
    Derive titles from the module.json description field (already descriptive) and directory slug names. Keep the same pattern as modules 06, 08-18 which already have good titles.

    **Rename 18 experiment files** to example (same pattern as Phase 1/3/4 non-standard filename migrations):
    For each file matching *-experiment.md in content/courses/flutter:
    1. Read the frontmatter to confirm type is EXAMPLE
    2. Rename file: NN-experiment.md -> NN-example.md
    3. No content changes needed (frontmatter already says EXAMPLE)
    Files are in: M02 (1), M04 (1), M07 (5), M09 (7 -- all in archived Firebase lessons), M10 (2 -- in misplaced lessons), M11 (2)

    **Annotate archived lessons** in M09 (lessons 10-17, 19):
    Read each lesson.json for M09 lessons 10-17 and 19. If the title contains "[Archive]", ensure the lesson.json has a clear indication. Add to each archived lesson.json:
    - If not already present, add "archived": true to the lesson.json
    - If the description contains "[Legacy content]", keep it
    These 9 lessons should NOT be audited for accuracy in subsequent plans.

    **Document misplaced lessons** in M10 (L06-L08) and M11 (L09-L10):
    Read each lesson.json. Add a note in the description field indicating the content is misplaced:
    - M10 L06 (Device Features): Add "[Note: This lesson covers device features, not backend testing. Content retained for student reference.]"
    - M10 L07 (Background Tasks): Same pattern
    - M10 L08 (Fitness Tracker): Same pattern
    - M11 L09 (CI/CD): "[Note: This lesson covers CI/CD, which is also covered in M16. Content retained for completeness.]"
    - M11 L10 (Testing Best Practices): "[Note: This lesson covers testing, which is also covered in M14. Content retained for completeness.]"
    Do NOT move lessons between modules (would break IDs and references). Annotate only.

    **Update M09 module.json** description to note that lessons 10-19 are archived legacy content.
    **Update M10 module.json** description to note it contains 5 testing lessons + 3 device/project lessons.
    **Update M11 module.json** description to note it contains 8 API/auth lessons + 2 supplementary lessons.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Verify all 6 module.json titles are descriptive (grep for "Flutter Development" should return zero matches in module.json files).
    Verify zero experiment.md files remain (glob for *experiment* in flutter content).
    Verify M09 archived lesson.json files have "archived": true.
    Verify M10/M11 misplaced lessons have descriptive notes.
  </verify>
  <done>
    All 18 module titles are descriptive. All 18 experiment files renamed to example. 9 archived lessons annotated with "archived": true. 5 misplaced lessons annotated with placement notes. Module descriptions updated to reflect actual content.

1. `grep -r "Flutter Development" content/courses/flutter/modules/*/module.json` returns zero matches
2. No files matching `*experiment*` exist under content/courses/flutter/
3. Version manifest flutter.runtime.version contains "3.38"
4. course.json minimumRuntimeVersion contains "3.38"
5. M09 lessons 10-17 and 19 all have "archived": true in lesson.json

<success_criteria>
- Version manifest and course.json aligned to Flutter 3.38.x/Dart 3.10.x
- Zero generic module titles remaining
- Zero non-standard experiment filenames remaining
- Archived and misplaced lessons clearly annotated
- Structural foundation clean for accuracy passes
