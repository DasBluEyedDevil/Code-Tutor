<objective>
Global sweep of the entire Flutter course: validate all JSON files, sweep for stale version references, verify no non-standard filenames remain, confirm progression continuity, and get human approval for phase completion.

Purpose: Final quality gate before marking Phase 5 complete. Catches any survivors from the accuracy passes and enrichment. Follows the established pattern from Phases 2-4 (global verification + human checkpoint).
Output: Clean course ready for production. Phase 5 marked complete.

  <name>Task 1: JSON validation + stale reference sweep + filename check</name>
  <files>
    content/courses/flutter/modules/*/lessons/*/lesson.json

  </files>
  <action>
    **JSON Validation:**
    Parse every JSON file in the Flutter course directory. Report any parse errors:
    - course.json (1 file)
    - module.json (18 files)
    - lesson.json (~153 files)
    - challenge.json (~217 files)
    Total target: ~389 JSON files
    Fix any malformed JSON (missing commas, trailing commas, unescaped quotes).

    **Stale Version Reference Sweep:**
    Grep across ALL content files (*.md) in the Flutter course for:
    - "Flutter 3.27" -- should be zero (updated to 3.38 in 05-01)
    - "Dart 3.6" -- should be zero (updated to 3.10 in 05-01)
    - "Dart 3.0" -- acceptable if referring to "since Dart 3.0" for null safety
    - "^2.4.0" (Riverpod) -- should be updated to ^2.6.1
    - "^14.0.0" (GoRouter) -- should be updated to ^17.0.0
    - "WillPopScope" -- should be zero (replaced by PopScope)
    - "FlatButton|RaisedButton" -- should be zero (deprecated since Flutter 2.0)
    - "sdk: '>=3.0.0" -- should be >=3.10.0 (unless in historical context)
    Fix any survivors found.

    **Non-standard Filename Check:**
    Glob for any remaining non-standard content filenames:
    - *experiment* (should have been renamed to example in 05-01)
    - *architecture* (should be theory)
    - *real_world* (should be analogy)
    - *deep_dive* (should be theory)
    - *concept* (should be theory)
    - *code.md (should be example)
    - *pitfalls* (should be warning)
    Should all return zero matches.

    **Content Type Frontmatter Check:**
    Sample 20 content files across different modules. Verify frontmatter type matches filename:
    - *-theory.md should have `type: THEORY`
    - *-example.md should have `type: EXAMPLE`
    - *-key_point.md should have `type: KEY_POINT`
    - *-analogy.md should have `type: ANALOGY`
    - *-warning.md should have `type: WARNING`

    **Archived lesson verification:**
    Confirm M09 archived lessons (L10-L17, L19) all have "archived": true in lesson.json.
    Confirm misplaced lesson notes are present in M10 L06-L08 and M11 L09-L10.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Report: X JSON files validated, Y errors found/fixed.
    Report: X stale references found/fixed.
    Report: X non-standard filenames found (should be 0).
    Report: Content type frontmatter consistency (should be 100%).
  </verify>
  <done>
    All ~389 JSON files validate. Zero stale version references. Zero non-standard filenames. Content type frontmatter consistent. Archived/misplaced lessons properly annotated.

  <what-built>
    Complete Flutter/Dart course audit across 7 plans:
    - 05-01: Version alignment (Flutter 3.38/Dart 3.10), 6 module titles fixed, 18 files renamed, archived lessons annotated
    - 05-02: M01-M07 accuracy pass (53 lessons -- Dart fundamentals, widgets, Riverpod 2.x, GoRouter 17.x)
    - 05-03: M08-M13 accuracy pass (~44 active lessons -- Dart Frog 1.2.x with community status, Serverpod 2.x with 3.x warnings, testing, API, real-time, offline)
    - 05-04: M14-M18 accuracy pass (42 lessons -- testing, UI, deployment, capstone consistency)
    - 05-05: 44 KEY_POINT files + ~15 WARNING files for M11-M14
    - 05-06: Challenge validation (217 challenges) + ~25 ANALOGY files + capstone assessment
    - 05-07: JSON validation + global sweep

    Requirements addressed:
    - FLTR-01: Every lesson reviewed for accuracy against Flutter 3.38/Dart 3.10
    - FLTR-02: Progressive curriculum verified from Dart basics through capstone
    - FLTR-03: All challenges validated (pure Dart executed, backend code-reviewed)
    - FLTR-04: Capstone project assessed for deployability
    - FLTR-05: Dart Frog verified against 1.2.x APIs with community status documented
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Browse the Flutter course in the app -- verify module titles are descriptive (not "Module X: Flutter Development")
    2. Open a lesson in M06 (Riverpod) -- verify it teaches 2.x patterns with a note about 3.x
    3. Open M08 L01 (Dart Frog) -- verify community maintenance status is documented
    4. Open M09 L02 (Serverpod Setup) -- verify CLI version pin warning is present
    5. Open a lesson in M05 or M12 -- verify KEY_POINT content exists
    6. Open a lesson in M11 or M13 -- verify WARNING content exists
    7. Spot-check any lesson in M08-M18 -- verify it has an ANALOGY
    8. Run a Dart challenge from M02 in the app (if Dart SDK available locally)
    9. Review the capstone assessment in 05-06 summary -- confirm FLTR-04 status
