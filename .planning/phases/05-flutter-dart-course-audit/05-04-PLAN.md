<objective>
Verify accuracy of Modules 14-18 (42 lessons, ~280 content files) covering frontend testing, advanced UI, deployment, production operations, and the social chat capstone project. Ensure capstone uses patterns consistent with earlier modules.

Purpose: These are the advanced and culmination modules. The capstone (M18) must be internally consistent with all earlier teachings (Riverpod 2.x, Serverpod 2.x, GoRouter 17.x) or students will encounter contradictions.
Output: All M14-M18 content verified with capstone consistency confirmed.

    Read ALL content files for M14-M17 (30 lessons, ~200 files).

    **M14 Frontend Testing (7 lessons):**
    - Unit testing with package:test -- verify current API
    - Widget testing: testWidgets(), pumpWidget(), find.byType(), find.text() -- stable API, should be correct
    - Golden testing: matchesGoldenFile() -- verify current usage
    - Integration testing: integration_test package -- verify current approach (IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding)
    - TDD patterns -- verify methodology is sound
    - Mock patterns (mockito, mocktail) -- verify which package is used and if current
    - Verify any Riverpod testing uses 2.x patterns (ProviderScope overrides)

    **M15 Advanced UI (9 lessons):**
    - Implicit animations (AnimatedContainer, AnimatedOpacity, etc.) -- stable API
    - Explicit animations (AnimationController, Tween, AnimatedBuilder) -- verify AnimatedBuilder vs AnimatedWidget usage
    - Hero animations -- stable API
    - Responsive design (LayoutBuilder, MediaQuery, Breakpoints) -- verify approach
    - Accessibility (Semantics widget, screen reader support) -- verify current best practices
    - Internationalization (intl package, l10n) -- verify gen-l10n approach is current
    - Custom painting (CustomPainter) -- stable API
    - Slivers and advanced scrolling -- verify SliverList, SliverGrid, SliverAppBar
    - Performance profiling -- verify DevTools references are current

    **M16 Deployment & DevOps (8 lessons):**
    - Flutter build commands: `flutter build apk`, `flutter build ios`, `flutter build web` -- verify current syntax
    - App signing for Android (keystore) -- verify current process
    - App Store submission process -- verify current requirements
    - Play Store submission -- verify current process
    - CI/CD with GitHub Actions or Codemagic -- verify workflow syntax is current
    - Web deployment (Firebase Hosting, Vercel, etc.)
    - Verify any Docker references use current Flutter base images

    **M17 Production Operations (6 lessons):**
    - Crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics or Sentry) -- verify current SDK integration
    - Analytics (Firebase Analytics or custom) -- verify current patterns
    - Feature flags -- verify implementation patterns
    - App updates and versioning -- verify current approach
    - Performance monitoring
    - Verify any Firebase references use current FlutterFire packages

    **What to fix:**
    - Outdated package versions in pubspec examples
    - Incorrect test API usage
    - Outdated CI/CD workflow syntax (GitHub Actions runner versions, etc.)
    - Outdated app store submission requirements
    - Any Riverpod/GoRouter/Serverpod references that don't match M06/M07/M09 decisions

    **What NOT to fix:**
    - Do NOT add KEY_POINTs, WARNINGs, or ANALOGYs (separate plan)
    - Do NOT modify challenges (separate plan)

    Verify CI/CD examples use current syntax.
    Count corrections made.

  <done>
    M14 (7 lessons), M15 (9 lessons), M16 (8 lessons), M17 (6 lessons) verified against current Flutter/Dart patterns. Testing, UI, deployment, and operations content all current.

    content/courses/flutter/modules/18-capstone-social-chat-app/lessons/*/content/*.md
  </files>
  <action>
    Read ALL content files for M18 (12 lessons, ~80 files). This is the capstone -- it must be internally consistent with all earlier module teachings.

    **Verify capstone framework versions match course decisions:**
    - Riverpod: Must use 2.x Notifier patterns (matching M06). NOT 3.x unified Ref.
    - GoRouter: Must use ^17.0.0 patterns (matching M07). NOT ^14.0.0.
    - Serverpod: Must use 2.x endpoint/ORM patterns (matching M09). Include CLI version pin note.
    - Drift: Must use 2.x patterns (matching M13) if local DB is used.
    - Flutter SDK: Must reference >=3.10.0 in any pubspec examples.

    **Verify capstone teaches a complete buildable project:**
    - L01: Project setup and architecture overview
    - Social chat app structure (user profiles, chat rooms, messaging, presence)
    - Authentication flow (should use Serverpod 2.x auth OR manual JWT)
    - Real-time messaging (WebSockets or Serverpod streams)
    - State management with Riverpod 2.x
    - Navigation with GoRouter 17.x
    - Testing (at least basic test examples)
    - Deployment guidance

    **Check for cross-module consistency:**
    - If capstone imports from packages taught in earlier modules, verify version constraints match
    - If capstone teaches patterns, verify they match what M06-M13 taught
    - Any pubspec.yaml examples should have consistent version constraints

    **Capstone project artifact (FLTR-04):**
    - Research notes: "No standalone capstone project directory exists (no pubspec.yaml)"
    - The capstone exists as 12 teaching lessons, not a runnable project directory
    - For FLTR-04, the capstone content IS the project guide. Verify it's complete enough that a student could build the project by following the lessons
    - If the lessons include a complete pubspec.yaml and all source files inline, that satisfies FLTR-04
    - If critical files are missing (no pubspec, incomplete code), note what's missing in the summary

    **What to fix:**
    - Version constraint inconsistencies with earlier modules
    - Riverpod pattern inconsistencies (must be 2.x)
    - GoRouter pattern inconsistencies (must be 17.x)
    - Serverpod pattern inconsistencies (must be 2.x with version pin)
    - Any broken code flow (imports referencing files not created in earlier lessons)
  </action>

    Grep capstone for "^14.0.0" GoRouter (should be zero -- should be ^17.0.0).
    Grep capstone for Riverpod version constraints (should be ^2.6.1).
    Grep capstone for Serverpod version constraints (should be ^2.0.0 with pin warning).
    Verify all 12 capstone lessons form a coherent project guide.
