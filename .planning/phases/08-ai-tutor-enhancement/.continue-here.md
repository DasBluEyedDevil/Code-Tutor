<current_state>
Phase 7 (Python Course Audit) just completed. All 6 course audits are finished. Ready to begin Phase 8: AI Tutor Enhancement.

This is the first non-content phase - we're moving from content cleanup to application enhancement.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
**All content phases complete (Phases 1-7):**
- Phase 1: Foundation and Content Normalization (6/6 plans)
- Phase 2: Java Course Audit (8/8 plans)
- Phase 3: JavaScript Course Audit (7/7 plans)
- Phase 4: C# Course Audit (5/5 plans)
- Phase 5: Flutter/Dart Course Audit (7/7 plans)
- Phase 6: Kotlin Course Audit (10/10 plans)
- Phase 7: Python Course Audit (5/5 plans)

**49/61 total plans complete (80%)**

**Content now stable for AI tutor RAG indexing.**
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
**Phase 8: AI Tutor Enhancement (4 plans planned in ROADMAP.md):**
- [ ] 08-01: ONNX Runtime GenAI upgrade (0.5.2 to current stable, verify Phi-4 inference works)
- [ ] 08-02: Socratic system prompt and lesson context injection (rewrite prompts, pass full lesson content)
- [ ] 08-03: Progressive hints and debug assistance (3-level hint system, failure-triggered help)
- [ ] 08-04: Tutor validation (test tutor against sample challenges across all 6 courses)

**Phase 9: UI and Engagement (4 plans):**
- Not started (depends on Phase 8)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
**Key decisions from prior phases affecting Phase 8:**
- Content must be stable before RAG indexing (satisfied - all 6 courses audited)
- ONNX Runtime GenAI is 12 versions behind (0.5.2 -> current) - upgrade is a known risk
- Phi-4 model is the target for local inference
- Socratic method is the teaching approach (guide students, don't give answers)
- Progressive hints: 3 levels (nudge → guidance → solution)

**Version manifest exists at:** `content/version-manifest.json`
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- ONNX Runtime GenAI upgrade (0.5.2 -> current) is a potential breaking change - needs careful testing
- No other blockers - content is ready
</blockers>

<context>
**Project context:**
Code Tutor is a WPF desktop app with 6 programming courses (812 lessons total). The AI tutor uses Phi-4 via ONNX Runtime GenAI for local inference. Current tutor gives direct answers instead of guiding students.

**Phase 8 goals (from ROADMAP.md):**
1. Tutor asks guiding questions (Socratic method) rather than giving direct answers
2. Tutor receives full lesson content as context (not just title)
3. Progressive hints when stuck (nudge → guidance → solution)
4. Debugging suggestions tied to lesson concepts
5. ONNX Runtime upgrade from 0.5.2 to current stable

**App architecture:**
- WPF desktop app (apps/desktop)
- Content in `content/courses/{language}/`
- AI tutor likely in apps/desktop with ONNX runtime

**Where to look:**
- `apps/desktop/` - Main application code
- Check for ONNX/Phi-4 integration files
- Look for existing system prompts
- Find where lesson context is passed to tutor
</context>

<next_action>
Start with: `/gsd-plan-phase 8`

This will:
1. Read ROADMAP.md Phase 8 requirements (TUTR-01 through TUTR-05)
2. Explore apps/desktop to understand current tutor implementation
3. Assess ONNX Runtime GenAI upgrade path
4. Create detailed plans for the 4 Phase 8 tasks

**Alternative:** If you want to explore first before planning:
```
ls apps/desktop/
grep -r "ONNX\|Phi\|tutor" apps/desktop/ --include="*.cs"
```
</next_action>
