      "HTML renderer is deprecated (Flutter 3.27+) and will be removed (Flutter 3.29+) - lesson presents it as current option",
      "Flutter 3.22+ should be updated to 3.24+ as the recommended minimum for Wasm",
      "The Wasm renderer description is inaccurate - Flutter uses 'skwasm' renderer for Wasm builds, not a separate 'Wasm renderer'",
      "Browser version for Safari incorrectly states 18+ (Sep 2024) - Safari/WebKit still does NOT support WasmGC fully",

      "Remove HTML renderer as a current option and add note about its deprecation",
