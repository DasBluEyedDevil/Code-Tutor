  "priority": "HIGH",
  "summary": "This lesson covers essential troubleshooting topics but has significant freshness issues. The Flutter version (3.24.0) and Java requirements (Java 11) are outdated - current versions are Flutter 3.38.1 requiring Java 17. The CocoaPods installation instructions are problematic for Apple Silicon Macs. Several sections have placeholder text without actual content (Windows PATH instructions). The DevTools section is comprehensive and mostly current. Priority is HIGH because outdated Java version information will cause beginners to encounter additional errors when following the lesson."
