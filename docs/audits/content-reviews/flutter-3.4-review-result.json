  "priority": "HIGH",
  "summary": "This lesson covers fundamental responsive layout concepts but has significant gaps. While the MediaQuery.sizeOf content is current and accurate (Flutter 3.10+), the lesson is missing critical responsive design tools including LayoutBuilder, SafeArea, and flexible sizing widgets. The lesson lacks an analogy section, warning section, and comprehensive examples. The challenge description is incomplete and the content sections are too brief. Given that responsive design is a core skill for Flutter developers and this lesson is in the 'Flutter Development' module, these gaps should be addressed with high priority."
