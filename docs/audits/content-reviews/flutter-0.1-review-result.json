  "challengeIssues": {
    "issues": [
      "Challenge type is FREE_CODING but the actual exercise is running terminal commands, not writing Dart code",
      "The starter code and solution don't match the exercise type - they're placeholder Dart code for a terminal-based exercise",
      "Hints about 'if statements' and 'null safety' are completely irrelevant to an installation verification exercise",
      "Common mistakes listed (semicolons, null safety, async/await) don't apply to this lesson at all",
      "Test cases check for print statements but the real verification is running flutter commands in terminal",
      "The solution is just comments explaining what to do in terminal, not actual verification"

    "recommendations": [
      "Change challenge type to PRACTICAL or SETUP instead of FREE_CODING",
      "Remove irrelevant hints about if statements and null safety",
      "Remove irrelevant common mistakes about Dart syntax - replace with installation-related mistakes",

      "Add clear instructions that this is a terminal exercise, not a coding exercise"
    ]
  },
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "summary": "This lesson has significant issues that require immediate attention. The core installation instructions are incomplete (missing code blocks for Mac/Linux PATH setup, missing Windows GUI instructions), version numbers are outdated (3.24.0 vs 3.38.1), and the Impeller information needs updating. The challenge section is fundamentally mismatched - it's a terminal verification exercise disguised as a Dart coding challenge with completely irrelevant hints and common mistakes. The lesson needs comprehensive updates to be useful for beginners in 2025."
