  "summary": "The lesson provides solid coverage of Flutter drawer navigation fundamentals with both Material 2 and Material 3 approaches. Main issues: (1) The WARNING section and several code examples are incomplete, (2) UserAccountsDrawerHeader is mentioned but never demonstrated, (3) Several features mentioned in the summary (badges, GoRouter, custom widths) lack examples, (4) Missing prerequisite context for intermediate learners. The challenge solution is excellent and comprehensive. Priority is MEDIUM because the core concepts are correct but gaps in examples and incomplete sections could confuse learners."
