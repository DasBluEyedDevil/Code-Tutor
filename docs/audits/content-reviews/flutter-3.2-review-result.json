      "GridView.count and GridView.extent examples are syntactically correct but incomplete - they show empty children lists or Container widgets without context",

      "sectionType": "ANALOGY",
      "title": "Grids Are Like Photo Albums",
      "contentOutline": "Compare GridView to a physical photo album where photos are arranged in rows and columns. Explain how the album (GridView) holds the photos (children), and how you can choose fixed columns (crossAxisCount) or let the album adjust based on photo size (maxCrossAxisExtent). This builds intuition for the 2D layout concept."

      "sectionType": "THEORY",
      "title": "Understanding Main Axis and Cross Axis",
      "contentOutline": "Explain that in a vertical GridView: main axis = vertical (scroll direction), cross axis = horizontal (where columns go). In a horizontal GridView, these are swapped. Essential terminology for understanding crossAxisCount, crossAxisSpacing, mainAxisSpacing."

      "sectionType": "EXAMPLE",
      "title": "GridView.builder - The Most Important Constructor",
      "contentOutline": "Demonstrate GridView.builder with itemBuilder and itemCount for dynamically generating grid items. Show SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount with all properties: crossAxisCount, crossAxisSpacing, mainAxisSpacing, childAspectRatio. Explain why builder is preferred for large datasets."

      "sectionType": "THEORY",
      "title": "Controlling Grid Item Size with childAspectRatio",
      "contentOutline": "Explain how childAspectRatio works (width/height ratio), why default is 1.0 (square items), and how to calculate it for different layouts. Show examples: 0.75 for portrait cards, 1.5 for landscape thumbnails."

      "sectionType": "WARNING",
      "title": "Common GridView Mistakes",
      "contentOutline": "Cover: 1) Forgetting childAspectRatio causes squished/stretched items, 2) Not wrapping GridView in Expanded when inside Column, 3) Using shrinkWrap: true unnecessarily which disables lazy loading, 4) Infinite height errors when GridView is not constrained."

  "priority": "HIGH",
  "summary": "This lesson provides basic GridView introduction but has significant gaps. The theory sections are too brief (most under 50 words), missing critical concepts like GridView.builder (the most important constructor), childAspectRatio, axis terminology, and spacing. No analogy or warning sections exist. The challenge solution is well-written but uses concepts not explained in the lesson (GridView.builder, SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount, childAspectRatio). Common mistakes are generic placeholders not related to GridView. Priority is HIGH due to the mismatch between taught content and challenge requirements."
