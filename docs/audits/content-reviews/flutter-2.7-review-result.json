      "CRITICAL: Lesson incorrectly states that 'Colors.blue does NOT have a shorthand because Colors is a class with static constants, not an enum.' This is FALSE - Dart 3.10 dot shorthands work with ALL static members (static fields, getters, methods, constructors), not just enums. 'color: .blue' is valid syntax when the parameter type is Color.",
      "The distinction between enums and static constants is misleading - dot shorthands work for both as long as the context type is clear",
      "The common mistake example 'Trying to shorten Colors.blue to .blue' with 'Compilation error' consequence is INCORRECT - this is actually valid Dart 3.10 syntax",

  "summary": "This lesson contains a critical accuracy error: it incorrectly states that Colors class static constants (like Colors.blue) cannot use dot shorthands because they are 'not enums'. This is factually incorrect - Dart 3.10 dot shorthands work with ALL static members including static fields, methods, and constructors, not just enum values. The lesson's challenge, solution, test cases, and common mistakes section all reinforce this incorrect information. This must be fixed urgently as it teaches learners a fundamental misconception about Dart 3.10 features. Additionally, the lesson is incomplete - it omits major use cases like switch statements, constructor shorthands (very common in Flutter with EdgeInsets, BorderRadius, etc.), and static method shorthands.",
