      "Code examples use outdated @override syntax without const constructors - modern Flutter requires const constructors for StatelessWidget classes",
      "Missing super.key parameter in widget constructors - Dart 2.17+ introduced super initializers which should be used: 'const BusinessCardApp({super.key})'",
      "ContactCard class uses non-const constructor with required parameters but should use const: 'const ContactCard({super.key, required this.icon, required this.text})'",
      "EdgeInsets.symmetric and EdgeInsets.all should use const: 'const EdgeInsets.symmetric(...)'",
      "Missing step 4 and step 5 in the progression - lesson jumps from Step 3 to Step 6, creating confusion",
      "The ASCII diagram code block is marked as 'dart' language but is not valid Dart code"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Update all StatelessWidget classes to use const constructors with super.key: 'class BusinessCardApp extends StatelessWidget { const BusinessCardApp({super.key}); ... }'",
      "Add const keyword to all EdgeInsets, TextStyle, and other immutable widget constructors",
      "Add missing Steps 4 and 5 (likely adding name/title text and a divider)",

    "gaps": [
      "Steps 4 and 5 are completely missing from the lesson - jumps from Step 3 (Profile Photo) to Step 6 (Contact Info Cards)",

      "Missing final complete code example that combines all steps",

    "recommendations": [
      "Add missing Steps 4 and 5 to complete the project flow",
      "Add a section explaining SafeArea and why it's needed (notches, status bars)",
