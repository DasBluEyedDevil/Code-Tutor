  "priority": "HIGH",
  "summary": "This lesson is critically incomplete. Despite the title 'Mini-Project - Instagram-Style Feed', it contains only theoretical bullet points and NO actual implementation code. The lesson promises stories, posts, like buttons, and responsive grids but delivers none of these. The single challenge is about adaptive grids (not Instagram feed) and has formatting errors. For a mini-project lesson, learners expect to build something substantial - this lesson fails to deliver on its promise. Immediate content expansion is required."
