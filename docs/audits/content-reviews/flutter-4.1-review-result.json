      "Code examples are syntactically correct but InkWell example has a potential issue - wrapping Container directly in InkWell may not show proper ripple effect; needs Material ancestor or should use Ink widget",

  "challengeIssues": {
    "issues": [
      "Hints are generic and not specific to Flutter buttons (mentions println instead of print, mentions if statements which aren't relevant)",
      "Common mistakes listed are generic Dart issues, not button-specific mistakes",
      "Starter code doesn't import flutter/material.dart which is required",
      "Test case is too simple - just checks if widget builds, doesn't verify button types"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Update hints to be button-specific: 'Remember to add onPressed callback', 'Use styleFrom() for styling'",
      "Update common mistakes to button-specific: 'Setting onPressed to null accidentally', 'Forgetting child widget'",
      "Include proper imports in starter code",
      "Add more specific test cases to verify multiple button types are used"

  },
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "summary": "The lesson has a solid foundation with correct code examples and good structure, but suffers from incomplete content sections (Colors, Size sections are just headers), missing critical Material 3 button types (FilledButton, FilledButton.tonal), and lacks pedagogical elements like analogies and warning sections. The button types section only shows code for FAB while listing others without examples. The challenge hints and common mistakes are generic rather than button-specific. Priority is HIGH because incomplete sections and missing button types would confuse beginners and leave them with outdated knowledge."
