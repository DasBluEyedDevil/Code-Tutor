  "priority": "HIGH",
  "summary": "The lesson provides a solid foundation for variable basics with a good analogy and covers null safety well. However, it critically omits 'final' and 'const' keywords which are fundamental to modern Dart development and emphasized in Effective Dart guidelines. The lesson should be updated to include these keywords, add a decision guide for choosing between var/final/const, and include more Flutter-specific examples. The challenge solution also needs updating to avoid hardcoded year values."
