  "challengeReview": {
    "score": 6,
    "issues": [
      "The challenge hints are too generic ('Read the instructions carefully') and don't help with Flutter-specific concepts",
      "Common mistakes listed (semicolons, null safety, async/await) are not relevant to this layout-focused lesson",
      "Test cases describe expected output but aren't actually executable tests",
      "The solution is comprehensive but may be overwhelming for beginners - could use step-by-step build-up"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Replace hints with layout-specific guidance: 'Use Column as the outer container', 'Remember Row for horizontal arrangements'",
      "Update common mistakes to layout-relevant issues: 'Forgetting to wrap Row in Expanded when inside Column', 'Using mainAxisAlignment instead of crossAxisAlignment'",
      "Add intermediate challenges before the social media post: simpler 2-widget Row, then 3-widget Column, then combination"
    ]
  },
  "summary": "The lesson covers fundamental Column and Row concepts but has notable gaps. The biggest issues are: 1) Missing the new Flutter 3.27 'spacing' property which significantly simplifies child spacing, 2) Incomplete coverage of Flexible vs Expanded vs Spacer, 3) Shallow treatment of common mistakes without showing problem code and solutions, 4) Missing mainAxisSize explanation which is critical for nested layouts. The lesson would benefit from more complete runnable examples and a troubleshooting guide for overflow errors. The challenge is good but hints and common mistakes need to be more relevant to layout concepts."
