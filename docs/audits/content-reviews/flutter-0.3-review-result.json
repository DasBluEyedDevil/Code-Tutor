      "Line numbers referenced (line 31, line 94, line 96) are specific to older Flutter templates and may not match current Flutter 3.38.x counter app template",
      "The lesson mentions 'about 110 lines of code' in main.dart but current flutter create generates a more concise template with Material 3 defaults",
      "The 'blue app bar' description is outdated - Flutter 3.16+ uses Material 3 by default with ColorScheme.fromSeed, resulting in different default colors (often purple/indigo based)",
      "Hot Restart shortcut listed as 'Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + F5' - the standard is just the circular arrow button or 'flutter clean && flutter run'; keyboard shortcuts vary by IDE configuration",
      "Widget test example uses 'MyApp()' without 'const' keyword which would trigger linter warning in modern Flutter"

  "summary": "The lesson provides a solid introduction to running a first Flutter app but contains several outdated references to Flutter's pre-Material 3 era. Line number references are fragile and will break with Flutter updates. The widget testing section is premature for Module 0 and should be removed. The lesson would benefit from a WARNING section on common issues and better troubleshooting guidance. Overall structure is good but needs freshness updates for Flutter 3.38.x and Material 3 defaults."
