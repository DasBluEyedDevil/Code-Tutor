  "additionalNotes": "One of the stronger lessons with excellent bakery automation analogy. The quality gates section is particularly well done. Main issues are incomplete workflow examples - many are referenced in text but code blocks are missing or partial. The Codemagic section is comprehensive and practical. The quiz and answer key are well-designed. Deploy to Stores workflow is complete and valuable."
