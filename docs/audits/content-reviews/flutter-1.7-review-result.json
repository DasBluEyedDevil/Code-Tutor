  "priority": "HIGH",
  "summary": "This lesson has a critical flaw: it teaches building a 'guessing game' but never teaches how to get actual user input. All examples use hardcoded arrays of simulated guesses, which defeats the purpose of an interactive game. The challenge section is broken with identical starter code and solution that contain only output text, not Dart code. The lesson needs a prerequisite section on dart:io and stdin.readLineSync() before attempting to build the game. Additionally, the lesson introduces class syntax (GameConfig) before classes have been taught in the curriculum. Despite good progressive structure (Version 1-5), the missing input handling and broken challenges make this lesson ineffective for teaching real game development."
