      "Hints reference 'print/println' which is not relevant to a UI challenge",

  "priority": "MEDIUM",
  "summary": "The lesson provides a solid introduction to Flutter app structure with good analogies (LEGO pieces, video game start button) and clear explanations of main(), runApp(), and the widget tree concept. Code examples are accurate for current Flutter. Main issues: 1) Challenge content needs significant revision (hints and common mistakes are mismatched to lesson content), 2) Missing WARNING section for common beginner errors, 3) Could benefit from Material Design and hot reload explanations, 4) Some pedagogical gaps around import statements and property naming conventions. The core technical content is accurate and well-structured for beginners."
