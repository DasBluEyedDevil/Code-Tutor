  "reviewNotes": "This lesson teaches a pattern that Flutter officially no longer recommends for most applications. While the technical content is mostly accurate, the lesson presents named routes as 'the solution' without acknowledging their significant limitations and deprecated status. For a tutorial platform, this could lead learners to adopt patterns they'll need to migrate away from in production apps. The lesson should be updated to either (1) clearly position named routes as a legacy/learning pattern while teaching go_router as the modern approach, or (2) restructure the navigation module to teach go_router primarily with named routes as historical context.",
