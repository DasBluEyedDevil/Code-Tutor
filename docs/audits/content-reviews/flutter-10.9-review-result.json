  "additionalNotes": "This mini-project has significant gaps that would prevent a learner from actually completing it. Missing: (1) Task model implementation, (2) entire Section 6 on integration tests, (3) BLoC implementation, (4) several widget implementations, (5) script contents. The test examples shown (repository tests, widget tests) are good patterns but learners can't follow along without the implementations. The grading rubric is well-structured. Needs substantial additions to be a usable project guide."
