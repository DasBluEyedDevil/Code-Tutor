Imagine the difference between a food truck and a supercharged restaurant kitchen:

Food Truck (Browser JavaScript):
- Serves food directly to customers on the street
- Limited space and equipment
- Can't do heavy-duty cooking
- Works in one location at a time

Supercharged Kitchen (Bun):
- Behind the scenes, ULTRA-FAST equipment
- Can handle many orders simultaneously at blazing speed
- Access to storage, databases, file systems
- Built-in tools: no need to buy separate appliances!
- TypeScript menu cards work without translation
- Sends finished dishes out to customers

Bun is like Node.js, but reimagined for 2025. It's a JavaScript runtime that runs your code OUTSIDE the browser, but it's significantly faster and comes with batteries included: built-in TypeScript support, a package manager, bundler, and test runner. No extra tools needed!
