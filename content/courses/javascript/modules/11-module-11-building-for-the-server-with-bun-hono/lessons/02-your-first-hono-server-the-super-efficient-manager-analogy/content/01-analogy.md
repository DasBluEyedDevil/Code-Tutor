Imagine running a restaurant:

Without a manager (plain Bun.serve()):
- You handle every customer request manually
- You write the same instructions over and over
- You manage reservations, orders, payments all yourself
- Lots of repetitive work

With a super-efficient manager (Hono framework):
- The manager handles common tasks LIGHTNING FAST
- Organized system for taking orders (routes)
- Standardized way to serve dishes (responses)
- Easy to add new menu items (endpoints)
- Works anywhere: kitchen, food truck, catering (multi-platform!)
- Less work, more organized, and portable!

Hono is like an ultra-efficient, portable restaurant manager. It works with Bun, Node.js, Deno, and even in the cloud (Cloudflare Workers). It's the modern choice for building APIs in 2025!
