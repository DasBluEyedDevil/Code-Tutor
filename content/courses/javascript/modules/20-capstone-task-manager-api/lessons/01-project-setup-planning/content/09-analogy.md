title: "The Restaurant Kitchen"

Building an API is like designing a professional restaurant kitchen. You need a **menu** (API endpoints), a **prep station** (validation with Zod), a **pantry** (database with Prisma), a **security badge system** (JWT authentication), and **health inspections** (tests). Before cooking a single dish, professional kitchens plan their layout, equipment, and workflows. That is exactly what this project setup lesson does -- you are designing your kitchen before the first order comes in.
