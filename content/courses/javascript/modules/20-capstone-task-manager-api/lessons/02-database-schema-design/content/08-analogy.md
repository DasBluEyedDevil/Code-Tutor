A database schema is like designing a filing cabinet system for an office. Each **model** (User, Task, Category) is a drawer. Each **field** is a labeled folder inside that drawer. **Relations** are cross-references between drawers -- a task folder has a sticky note saying "belongs to User drawer, folder #42." **Indexes** are like alphabetical dividers that help you find folders quickly without searching every single one. Get the filing system right, and everything that follows (querying, updating, deleting) becomes straightforward.
