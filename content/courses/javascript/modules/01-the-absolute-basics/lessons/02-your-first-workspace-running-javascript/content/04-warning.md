Common mistakes:

1. Putting quotes around the numbers: console.log('100 - 45'); will display the text '100 - 45' instead of doing the math. Remove the quotes to make the computer calculate it.

2. Forgetting the console.log part: Just writing 100 - 45; won't display anything. You need console.log() to actually show the result.

3. Wrong symbols: Make sure you use * for multiplication (not x), and - for subtraction (not a dash that might look similar).
