Think of the code editor as your workshop - it's where you'll build and test your code. Just like a carpenter has a workbench where they can quickly test if a joint fits or a piece is the right size, Code Tutor is where you can quickly try out JavaScript code and see the results immediately.

Code Tutor runs JavaScript using Node.js - the same JavaScript engine that powers web browsers, but running on your computer. This means you can write and test JavaScript code without needing a web browser. The `console.log()` function works exactly the same way!

**To run JavaScript, you'll need Node.js installed:**

1. Download Node.js from https://nodejs.org
2. Install it (the default options are fine)
3. Restart Code Tutor

Once installed, write your code and click 'Run Code' to see the results!
