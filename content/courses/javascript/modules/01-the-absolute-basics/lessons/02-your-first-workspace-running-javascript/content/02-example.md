JavaScript runs from top to bottom. Every line is executed in order, allowing you to perform calculations and display multiple messages in a sequence.

```javascript
// 1. Performing Calculations
// The computer calculates the result first, then logs it.
console.log(10 + 20); // Result: 30

// 2. Sequential Execution
console.log('Step 1: Gathering ingredients');
console.log('Step 2: Mixing the batter');
console.log('Step 3: Baking the cake');

// 3. Combining Text and Math
// We can use the + sign to join text and numbers together.
console.log('Total score: ' + (500 + 45)); 

// Note: Using ( ) around math ensures the calculation happens 
// BEFORE it gets joined to the text.
```
