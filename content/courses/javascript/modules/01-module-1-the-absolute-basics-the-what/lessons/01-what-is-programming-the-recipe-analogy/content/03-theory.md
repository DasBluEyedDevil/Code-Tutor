Let's break down that code line by line:

1. Lines starting with // are comments. They're ignored by the computer. Think of them as sticky notes you leave for yourself (or other programmers) to explain what the code does.

2. console.log('Hello, World!'); - This is an instruction (we'll call it a 'statement' later). Let's unpack it:
   - console is like a special message board built into your web browser
   - log means 'write a message'
   - The text inside the parentheses and quotes ('Hello, World!') is the message we want to write
   - The semicolon ; at the end is like a period at the end of a sentence - it tells the computer 'this instruction is complete'

So the whole thing means: 'Computer, write the message Hello, World! to the console.'
