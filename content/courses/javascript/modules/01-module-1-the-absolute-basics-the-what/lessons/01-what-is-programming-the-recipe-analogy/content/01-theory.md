Imagine you're teaching a very literal robot to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You can't just say "make a sandwich" — the robot doesn't know what that means!

You have to break it down into tiny, specific steps: "Pick up the knife. Dip the knife into the peanut butter jar. Spread the peanut butter on one slice of bread." That's exactly what programming is.

> **Note:** Programming is writing a list of very specific instructions that a computer can follow.

The computer is like that literal robot — it will do exactly what you tell it to do, but nothing more. It can't guess what you mean, and it can't read your mind. You have to be crystal clear.

The "language" we use to give these instructions is called a programming language. Today, we're learning JavaScript, which is like giving instructions to a web browser.
