Common mistakes beginners make:

1.  **Forgetting the quotes:**
    `console.log(Alice);` won't work because the computer thinks `Alice` is a variable (a "box" we'll learn about soon), not text.

2.  **Forgetting the semicolon:**
    While JavaScript is forgiving about this, it's good practice to always end statements with `;`.

3.  **Misspelling console or log:**
    Programming is case-sensitive! `Console.log` or `console.Log` won't work.

4.  **Missing parentheses:**
    `console.log 'Alice';` won't work. The parentheses are how we "pass" the message to the log function.
