In JavaScript, we use `console.log()` to send messages to the screen. Think of it as the computer's way of "speaking" back to you.

```javascript
// This is a comment. The computer skips any line starting with //
// We use comments to explain our code to humans.

// The line below tells the computer to display text in the console:
console.log('Hello, World!');

// You can also output numbers and results of math:
console.log(100 + 50);

// Notice that text needs quotes (' '), but numbers do not.
