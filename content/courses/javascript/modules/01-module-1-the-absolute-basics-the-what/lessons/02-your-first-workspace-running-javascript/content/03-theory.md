Let's look at what's happening:

1. console.log(5 + 3); - The computer will actually do the math (5 + 3 = 8) and then display '8'. The computer evaluates (figures out) what's inside the parentheses first, then displays the result.

2. Multiple console.log statements run in order, from top to bottom. The computer executes them one at a time, like following a recipe step by step.

3. The + symbol does two things in JavaScript:
   - When used with numbers, it adds them: 5 + 3 = 8
   - When used with text (in quotes), it joins them together: 'Hello' + ' ' + 'World' becomes 'Hello World'

4. Notice the parentheses around (10 * 2) in the last example? That tells the computer 'do this math first, then join it with the text.'
