*   **Execution Flow**: Code runs from top to bottom, line by line.
*   **Math Operations**: You can do math (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) directly inside `console.log()`.
*   **Concatenation**: The `+` operator joins text strings together (e.g., `'Score: ' + 10`).
*   **Order of Operations**: Use parentheses `()` to control what gets calculated first.
