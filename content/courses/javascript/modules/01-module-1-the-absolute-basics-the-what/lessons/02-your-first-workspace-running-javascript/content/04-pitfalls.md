Common mistakes:

1.  **Putting quotes around numbers:**
    `console.log('100 - 45');` will display the text `100 - 45` instead of doing the math. Remove the quotes to make the computer calculate it.

2.  **Forgetting the `console.log`:**
    Just writing `100 - 45;` won't display anything. You need `console.log()` to actually show the result.

3.  **Wrong symbols:**
    Make sure you use `*` for multiplication (not `x`), and `-` for subtraction (not a dash or underscore).

4.  **Using Single Quotes for Templates:**
    Remember, `${...}` only works inside backticks (`` `...` ``), not single quotes (`'...'`).
