Think of the code editor as your workshop — it's where you'll build and test your code. Just like a carpenter has a workbench where they can quickly test if a joint fits or a piece is the right size, this environment is where you can quickly try out JavaScript code and see the results immediately.

We use **Node.js** to run JavaScript. It's the same JavaScript engine that powers web browsers, but it runs directly on the computer (or server). This means you can write and test JavaScript code without needing a web browser window open.

The `console.log()` function works exactly the same way here as it does in a browser console!

### Setting Up (Local Development)

If you were working on your own computer, you would need to:

1.  Download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
2.  Install it.
3.  Use a terminal to run your code.

But here, everything is pre-installed and ready for you. Just write your code and run it!
