Think of the code editor as your **workshop**—it's where you'll build and test your code. Just like a carpenter has a workbench where they can quickly test if a joint fits or a piece is the right size, this environment is where you can quickly try out JavaScript code and see the results immediately.

We are running JavaScript using **Node.js**—the same JavaScript engine that powers web browsers, but running on the server. This means you can write and test JavaScript code without needing a web browser console. The `console.log()` function works exactly the same way!

**How it works:**
1.  You write code in the editor.
2.  You click "Run".
3.  The computer executes your instructions top-to-bottom.
4.  Output appears in the console.
