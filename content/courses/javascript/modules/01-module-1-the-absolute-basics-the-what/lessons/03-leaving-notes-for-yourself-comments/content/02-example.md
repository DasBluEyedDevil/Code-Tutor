title: "The Power of Comments"
---

Comments are for humans, not computers. We use them to explain complex logic or temporarily disable code during testing (often called "commenting out").

```javascript
// 1. Single-line comments
// This is used for brief notes.
console.log('Main engine started.'); // You can also put notes here

// 2. Multi-line comments
/*
   This block of text is a multi-line comment.
   It is perfect for headers or long explanations
   of how a specific system works.
*/

// 3. Commenting out code
// Sometimes we want to "turn off" code without deleting it.
// console.log('This will not appear in the results.');

/*
console.log('Multiple lines');
console.log('can be turned off at once.');
*/

console.log('Systems check complete.');
```
