```javascript
// This is a single-line comment
// The computer ignores everything after the //

console.log('This runs!');  // You can also put comments at the end of a line

// console.log('This does NOT run because it is commented out');

/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  Everything between the /* and */ is ignored.
  This is useful for longer explanations.
*/

console.log('This also runs!');

/* You can also use multi-line comments
   to temporarily 'turn off' code:
   console.log('This is turned off');
   console.log('So is this');
*/
```
