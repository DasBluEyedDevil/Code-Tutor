Imagine you're cooking a complex recipe, and you write little notes in the margins: 'This takes 20 minutes' or 'Make sure the oven is preheated!' Those notes aren't part of the recipe itself - they're reminders to yourself.

Comments in code work the same way. They're notes you leave for yourself (or other programmers) that the computer completely ignores. The computer will skip right over them like they don't exist.

Why are comments important? Because code that makes perfect sense today might be confusing in a month. Comments explain WHY you wrote the code a certain way, not just WHAT the code does.
