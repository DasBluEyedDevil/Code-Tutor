  "description": "Create a payment processing system using discriminated unions:\n\n1. Create three interfaces for payment methods:\n   - `CreditCard` with: kind: 'credit', cardNumber: string, cvv: string\n   - `PayPal` with: kind: 'paypal', email: string\n   - `BankTransfer` with: kind: 'bank', accountNumber: string, routingNumber: string\n\n2. Create a union type `PaymentMethod` that includes all three\n\n3. Create a function `processPayment` that:\n   - Takes a PaymentMethod and amount: number\n   - Uses a switch statement on the 'kind' property\n   - Logs a different message for each payment type\n   - For credit: 'Processing credit card ending in XXXX'\n   - For PayPal: 'Processing PayPal payment for EMAIL'\n   - For bank: 'Processing bank transfer from account XXXX'\n\n4. Test with all three payment types",
