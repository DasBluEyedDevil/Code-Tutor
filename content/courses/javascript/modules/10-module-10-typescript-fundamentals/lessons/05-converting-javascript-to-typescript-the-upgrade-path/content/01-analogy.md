Imagine you have a bicycle and you want to upgrade it to an electric bike:

Bicycle (JavaScript):
- Works perfectly fine as-is
- You can ride it anywhere
- No extra features

E-bike (TypeScript):
- Same bicycle underneath
- Added motor, battery, controls
- More features and safety
- Still works as a regular bike if battery dies

Converting JavaScript to TypeScript is the same:
- Start with working JavaScript code
- Add type annotations (the electric components)
- Get extra safety and features
- The underlying logic stays the same!

You don't have to convert everything at once - you can gradually upgrade piece by piece.
