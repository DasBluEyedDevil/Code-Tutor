Imagine organizing a kitchen with a label maker:

Without labels (JavaScript):
- You can put anything in any container
- Sugar in the salt jar? Sure!
- Flour in the coffee can? Why not!
- You discover mistakes when you taste your food

With labels (TypeScript):
- Each container has a clear label
- You know immediately if you're putting the wrong thing in
- The label maker prevents you from mislabeling
- Mistakes are caught BEFORE cooking

TypeScript's basic types are like labels for your variables. They tell you (and the computer) what kind of data should go in each container.
