Imagine you work in a factory that makes shipping containers.

1.  **Specific Molds:** You could have a mold specifically for "Shipping Apples," another for "Shipping Electronics," and another for "Shipping Books." These molds are identical in shape, but they only allow one specific item inside. This is repetitive and wasteful.
2.  **The Flexible Mold:** You create a "Master Container Mold." This mold doesn't care what goes inside, but it ensures that whatever you put in comes out in a perfectly sized box. If you put in an Apple, you get an "Apple Box." If you put in a Book, you get a "Book Box."

In TypeScript, **Generics** are these flexible molds. They allow you to write a function or a class that "captures" the type of data you give it and uses that type to ensure safety. It’s a way of saying: "I don't know what type this is *yet*, but I promise to keep it consistent throughout this function."
