Imagine a Swiss Army knife:

Without versatility (specific tools):
- You need a separate knife for cutting bread
- A different knife for cutting rope
- Another knife for cutting paper
- Each tool only works with one material

With versatility (Swiss Army knife):
- One tool that adapts to many uses
- Same cutting motion, different materials
- The knife works with whatever you give it
- Still sharp and effective for each use

Generics in TypeScript work the same way. Instead of writing separate functions for numbers, strings, and objects, you write ONE function that works with ANY type you give it. The function adapts to the type, just like a Swiss Army knife adapts to the material.
