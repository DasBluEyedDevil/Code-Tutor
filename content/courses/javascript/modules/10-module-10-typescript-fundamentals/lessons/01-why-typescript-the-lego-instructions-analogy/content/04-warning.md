Common mistakes when starting with TypeScript:

1. **Forgetting the colon**: `width number` won't work - you need `width: number`
2. **Using the wrong type**: `width: string` when you mean numbers
3. **Thinking TypeScript runs in the browser**: TypeScript must be compiled to JavaScript first
4. **Over-typing everything**: Start simple, add types gradually
5. **Confusing TypeScript with JavaScript**: TypeScript is a superset - all valid JavaScript is valid TypeScript, but not all TypeScript features work in plain JavaScript

Remember: TypeScript is JavaScript with type safety training wheels. The training wheels help you learn to avoid crashes!
