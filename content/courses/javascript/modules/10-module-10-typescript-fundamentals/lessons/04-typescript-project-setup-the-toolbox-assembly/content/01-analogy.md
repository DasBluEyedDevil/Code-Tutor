Imagine you're setting up a woodworking shop:

Woodworking setup:
- You need tools (saw, hammer, drill)
- You need a workspace (workshop with proper layout)
- You need safety equipment (goggles, gloves)
- You need instructions on how to use everything

TypeScript project setup:
- You need TypeScript installed (the compiler)
- You need a configuration file (tsconfig.json)
- You need a folder structure (organized workspace)
- You need to know how to compile TS → JS

Just like you can't start woodworking without setting up your shop, you can't start a TypeScript project without proper configuration!
