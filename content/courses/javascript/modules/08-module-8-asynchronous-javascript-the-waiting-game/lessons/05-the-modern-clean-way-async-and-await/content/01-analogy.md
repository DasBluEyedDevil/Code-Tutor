Promises are like getting a tracking number for your package:

**Promises (.then)**: You keep checking the tracking number and saying 'THEN when it arrives, THEN I'll open it, THEN I'll use it, THEN I'll write a review...'

**async/await**: You just wait at the door for the package to arrive, open it when it comes, use it, write review - one step at a time, in order. More natural!

async/await is syntactic sugar over Promises. It makes asynchronous code LOOK and READ like synchronous code, while still being non-blocking. It's the modern, preferred way to handle async operations.
