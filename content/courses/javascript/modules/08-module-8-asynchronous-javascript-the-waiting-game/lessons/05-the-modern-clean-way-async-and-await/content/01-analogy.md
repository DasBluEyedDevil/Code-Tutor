Imagine you have a highly efficient personal assistant.

1.  **The Promise Way (.then):** You hand your assistant a list of tasks and say: "When you finish getting the dry cleaning, THEN go to the grocery store. THEN, once you have the groceries, THEN cook dinner." You're essentially giving them a chain of "What to do next" instructions.
2.  **The Async/Await Way:** You sit down with your assistant and say: "**Wait** for the dry cleaning to be ready. Once you have it, **wait** for the groceries to be bought. Finally, **wait** for the dinner to be cooked."

From your perspective, the second way feels much more like a normal conversation. You are describing the tasks in the order they happen. 

In JavaScript, `async/await` allows us to write asynchronous code that looks and reads exactly like the synchronous code we've been writing since Module 1. It hides the complexity of "Promises" and "Buzzers" behind two simple keywords.
