Building a house has three distinct phases:

**HTML (The Structure)**: This is like the wooden frame of a house - the walls, roof, floors. It defines WHAT exists (rooms, doors, windows) but not how they look or behave.

**CSS (The Styling)**: This is like painting, decorating, choosing furniture. It makes the structure LOOK good - colors, fonts, layouts, spacing.

**JavaScript (The Behavior)**: This is like the electrical wiring, plumbing, security system. It makes things WORK - lights turn on/off, doors lock/unlock, alarms sound.

You need all three! A house with just a frame is boring. A house with no wiring doesn't work. Together, they create a complete, functional, beautiful home.
