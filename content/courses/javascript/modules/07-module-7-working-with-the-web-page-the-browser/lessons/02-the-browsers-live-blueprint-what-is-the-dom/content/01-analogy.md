Imagine you're building with LEGO blocks. You have the instruction manual (HTML code), but you also have the actual LEGO structure you've built (the DOM).

The **DOM (Document Object Model)** is the browser's LIVE representation of your webpage. It's not the HTML code itself - it's the browser's interpretation of that code, turned into a tree of objects that JavaScript can manipulate.

Think of it like this:
- **HTML**: Blueprint on paper (static text)
- **DOM**: Actual LEGO construction (living, changeable structure)

When you use JavaScript to change the DOM, you're rebuilding parts of the LEGO structure on the fly. The browser immediately shows your changes on screen.
