Imagine you are setting up a "smart home." You have a sensor on your front door and a lightbulb in the hallway.

1.  **The Event:** This is the thing that happens. For example, "The door opens."
2.  **The Listener:** This is the sensor. It doesn't *do* anything on its own; it just sits there silently, "listening" for that specific door-opening action.
3.  **The Handler (Callback):** This is the instruction you gave the smart home: "WHEN the door opens, THEN turn on the hallway light."

In JavaScript, we use **Event Listeners** to connect user actions (like clicks, typing, or scrolling) to specific pieces of code. Without event listeners, your webpage is just a static picture. With them, it becomes a living, breathing application that reacts to everything the user does.
