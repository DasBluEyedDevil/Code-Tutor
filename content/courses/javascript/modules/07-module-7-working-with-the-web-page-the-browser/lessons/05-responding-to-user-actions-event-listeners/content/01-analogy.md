Imagine you're a security guard at a building:

You're not actively doing anything most of the time - you're LISTENING and WAITING for specific events to happen:

- **Event**: Someone presses the doorbell → **Response**: You open the door
- **Event**: Fire alarm goes off → **Response**: You evacuate everyone
- **Event**: Someone tries wrong password 3 times → **Response**: You lock them out

Event listeners work the same way. Your JavaScript code sits idle, LISTENING for specific events (clicks, key presses, mouse movements, etc.). When an event happens, your code RESPONDS by running a function.
