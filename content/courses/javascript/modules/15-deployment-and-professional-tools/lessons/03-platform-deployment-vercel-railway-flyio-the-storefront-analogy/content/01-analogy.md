Imagine opening a physical store:

Development (building in your garage):
- Test the store layout
- Only you can see it
- localhost:5173 (your garage address)
- Close garage door → store disappears

Production (real storefront on Main Street):
- Open to the public!
- Anyone can visit from anywhere
- https://my-store.vercel.app (real address)
- Open 24/7 (never closes)
- Professional hosting (like a shopping mall)

Deploying your React app is the same:
- Move from localhost to real internet
- Build optimized version (Vite build)
- Get a public URL (vercel.app or netlify.app)
- Hosted on fast servers worldwide (CDN)
- Connects to your deployed API!
