Imagine opening a food truck instead of a fixed restaurant:

Traditional restaurant (Express + Node):
- Fixed location (one platform)
- Heavy kitchen equipment
- Expensive to relocate
- Works great, but locked to one spot

Food truck (Hono):
- Same great recipes work anywhere!
- Set up at festivals (Cloudflare Workers)
- Park downtown (Render with Bun)
- Visit the beach (Deno Deploy)
- Light and portable equipment

Hono is the food truck of web frameworks:
- Write once, deploy anywhere
- Same code runs on Bun, Deno, Cloudflare Workers, Node
- Lightweight and blazing fast
- Edge-ready (runs close to users worldwide)

Popular deployment targets:
- Bun on Render (free tier!)
- Cloudflare Workers (edge computing)
- Deno Deploy (serverless)
- Traditional Node.js hosting
