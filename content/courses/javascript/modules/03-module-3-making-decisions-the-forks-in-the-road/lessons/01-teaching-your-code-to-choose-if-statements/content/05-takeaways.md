*   **`if` Statement**: Runs code only if a specific condition is `true`.
*   **Syntax**: `if (condition) { code }`
*   **Condition**: Anything inside `( )` is evaluated as a Boolean.
*   **Scope**: Use `{ }` to group multiple lines of code.
*   **Execution Flow**: If the condition is `false`, the code block is skipped entirely.
