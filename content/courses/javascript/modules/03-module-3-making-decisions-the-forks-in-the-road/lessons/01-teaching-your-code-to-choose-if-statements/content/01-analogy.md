Imagine you're a traffic cop at an intersection. When you see a red light, you tell cars to STOP. When you see a green light, you tell them to GO. You're making a decision based on a condition (the light color).

That's exactly what an 'if' statement does in code. It checks a condition (is something true or false?), and based on the answer, it decides what action to take.

Think of it like a flowchart with a diamond-shaped decision box: 'Is it raining?' If YES, take umbrella. If NO, leave it home. In code, we call these YES/NO questions 'conditions', and they always evaluate to either true or false (remember booleans from Module 2?).
