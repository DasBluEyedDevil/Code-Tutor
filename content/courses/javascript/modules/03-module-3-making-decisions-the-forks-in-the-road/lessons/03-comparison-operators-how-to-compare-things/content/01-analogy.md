When you're shopping, you constantly compare things:

'Is this apple bigger than that one?' (>)
'Is this shirt the same price as that one?' (===)
'Is this milk carton NOT expired?' (not equal to today's date)

In programming, we have special symbols for making these comparisons. They're called 'comparison operators', and they always give you a true/false answer - perfect for use in if statements!

Think of them as questions you can ask:
- '>' means 'Is this bigger?'
- '<' means 'Is this smaller?'
- '===' means 'Are these exactly the same?'
- '!==' means 'Are these different?'
