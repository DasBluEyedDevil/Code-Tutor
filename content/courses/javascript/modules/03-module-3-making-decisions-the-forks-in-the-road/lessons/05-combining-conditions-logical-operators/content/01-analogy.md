Sometimes you need to check multiple conditions at once:

'Can I go to the movies?' 
- I need money AND I need time AND the movie needs to be showing
- If ANY of these are false, I can't go

This is what the && operator does - it means 'AND'. All conditions must be true.

Or consider:
'Should I bring an umbrella?'
- IF it's raining OR IF it's cloudy OR IF the forecast says rain
- If ANY of these are true, bring it

This is what the || operator does - it means 'OR'. At least one condition must be true.

We also have ! which means 'NOT' - it flips true to false and vice versa.
