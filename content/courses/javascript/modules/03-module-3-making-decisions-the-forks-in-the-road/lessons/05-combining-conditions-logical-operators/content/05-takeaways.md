*   **AND (`&&`)**: True only if **both** sides are true.
*   **OR (`||`)**: True if **at least one** side is true.
*   **NOT (`!`)**: Flips `true` to `false` and vice versa.
*   **Precedence**: `&&` is evaluated before `||`. Use `( )` to be safe.
*   **Short-Circuiting**: Evaluation stops as soon as the result is determined.
