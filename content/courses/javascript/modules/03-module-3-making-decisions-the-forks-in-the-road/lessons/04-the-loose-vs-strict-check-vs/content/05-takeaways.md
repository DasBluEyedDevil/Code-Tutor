*   **Type Coercion**: JavaScript tries to convert types to make them match when using `==`.
*   **Loose Equality (`==`)**: Checks value but ignores type. Avoid using this.
*   **Strict Equality (`===`)**: Checks both value and type. Always use this.
*   **Best Practice**: Always prefer strict equality (`===` and `!==`) to prevent bugs.
