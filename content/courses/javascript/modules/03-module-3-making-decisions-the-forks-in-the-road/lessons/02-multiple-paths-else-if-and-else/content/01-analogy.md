Imagine you are ordering a set menu at a restaurant. The waiter follows a strict list of choices to determine what to bring you:

1.  **IF** you are a vegetarian, you get the Mushroom Risotto.
2.  **ELSE IF** you like seafood, you get the Grilled Salmon.
3.  **ELSE IF** you are very hungry, you get the Giant Steak.
4.  **ELSE** (if none of the above are true), you get the house Salad.

#### The "First Match" Rule
In this scenario, if you are a **Vegetarian who is also Very Hungry**, you still only get the Risotto. Why? Because the waiter stops checking as soon as they find the **first** thing that is true.

This is the power of the `if / else if / else` chain. It allows you to handle complex, mutually exclusive scenarios where only **one** possible outcome should happen.
