Over the next lessons, you'll build a production-ready Task Manager API. This isn't a toy project - it's a real API that demonstrates professional patterns:

**Features:**
- User registration and login with JWT authentication
- CRUD operations for tasks and categories
- Input validation with Zod
- Database persistence with Prisma and SQLite
- Owner-only access control
- Filtering and pagination

**Tech Stack:**
- **Bun** - Fast JavaScript runtime
- **TypeScript** - Type safety in strict mode
- **Hono** - Lightweight web framework
- **Prisma** - Type-safe database ORM
- **Zod** - Runtime validation
- **JWT** - Token-based authentication

By the end, you'll have a complete API that could serve a real mobile or web app.
