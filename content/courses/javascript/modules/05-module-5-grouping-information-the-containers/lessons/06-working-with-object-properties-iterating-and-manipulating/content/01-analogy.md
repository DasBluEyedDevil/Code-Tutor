Imagine you're a store clerk inventorying products. You need to go through each product and check its details:

'Product 1: Name = Laptop, Price = $1000'
'Product 2: Name = Mouse, Price = $25'

Just like we looped through arrays, we need to loop through objects. But objects don't have index numbers - they have property NAMES. JavaScript gives us special tools to work with object properties: get all keys, all values, or all key-value pairs.
