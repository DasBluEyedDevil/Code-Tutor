Imagine you rent a storage unit that consists of a single long row of identical lockers. 

To keep things organized, the facility manager painted a number on the front of each locker. But because the manager is a computer scientist, they started with the number **0**.

*   Locker 0: Your camping gear.
*   Locker 1: Your winter clothes.
*   Locker 2: Your old textbooks.

This row of lockers is an **Array**. It allows you to store many different things under a single "address" (the variable name), and access each specific item by its "locker number" (the **Index**).

#### Why use Arrays?
Instead of creating 50 separate variables for 50 users (`user1`, `user2`, `user3`...), you create one variable called `users` that holds all 50. This makes it much easier to sort them, search them, or perform an action on every single one using a loop.
