Imagine you have a shopping list written on paper:

1. Milk
2. Eggs
3. Bread
4. Butter

This is an ordered list - each item has a position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.). In programming, we call this an ARRAY. It's a single variable that can hold multiple values in a specific order.

Think of an array like a train with numbered cars: Car 0 has apples, Car 1 has bananas, Car 2 has cherries. The numbers (0, 1, 2) are called 'indices' (plural of index), and they tell you where each item is located.

Important quirk: Programming counts from 0, not 1! So the first item is at position 0, the second at position 1, and so on.
