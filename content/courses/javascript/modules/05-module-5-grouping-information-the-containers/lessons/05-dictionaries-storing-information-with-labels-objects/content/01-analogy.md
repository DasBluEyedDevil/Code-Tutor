Imagine you're filling out a form about yourself:

Name: Alice
Age: 25
City: New York
Is Student: true

Each piece of info has a LABEL (Name, Age, etc.) and a VALUE ('Alice', 25, etc.). This is different from an array, where items are accessed by position numbers. Here, you access items by NAME.

In JavaScript, this is called an OBJECT. Think of it like a real dictionary: you look up a WORD (the key) to find its DEFINITION (the value). Or like a person's contact card: each field (label) has a value.

Objects are perfect for representing things with named properties: a user, a product, a car, etc.
