Imagine your array is a line of people:

**push()**: Someone new joins the END of the line
**pop()**: The person at the END of the line leaves
**unshift()**: Someone cuts in at the FRONT of the line
**shift()**: The person at the FRONT of the line leaves

These four methods let you add or remove items from either end of an array. They're like doors - two at the back (push/pop) and two at the front (shift/unshift).
