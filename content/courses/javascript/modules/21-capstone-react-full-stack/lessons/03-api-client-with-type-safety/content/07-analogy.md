An API client is like a typed telephone system between your frontend and backend. Instead of dialing a raw number and hoping someone answers in the right language, you use a strongly-typed client that knows exactly which endpoints exist, what parameters they accept, and what shape the response will be. If you try to call an endpoint with the wrong data, TypeScript catches it before you even pick up the phone. The shared types package is the directory that both sides reference to stay in sync.
