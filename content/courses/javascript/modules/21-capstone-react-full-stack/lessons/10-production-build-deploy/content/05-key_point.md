You now have a complete full-stack application. Here is what was built across all 10 lessons:

1. **Monorepo** -- Bun workspaces managing api, web, and shared packages
2. **Shared types** -- TypeScript interfaces used by both frontend and backend
3. **API client** -- Type-safe fetch wrapper matching shared types
4. **React components** -- Functional components with hooks and state management
5. **Authentication UI** -- Login/register forms connected to the Module 20 API
6. **Protected routes** -- react-router-dom v6 with auth guards and redirect-after-login
7. **Data fetching** -- Custom hooks with loading/error states
8. **Forms** -- Controlled inputs with client-side validation
9. **Testing** -- React Testing Library for component and integration tests
10. **Deployment** -- Vite production build, Vercel for frontend, Railway for backend

This is a deployable, testable, full-stack JavaScript application built entirely with modern tools.
