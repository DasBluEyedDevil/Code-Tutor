Imagine you're at a UN meeting where everyone speaks different languages. A translator lets you communicate with anyone, regardless of their native language.

FFI (Foreign Function Interface) is Bun's translator. It lets your JavaScript talk directly to code written in C, Rust, Zig, or any language that compiles to native code.
