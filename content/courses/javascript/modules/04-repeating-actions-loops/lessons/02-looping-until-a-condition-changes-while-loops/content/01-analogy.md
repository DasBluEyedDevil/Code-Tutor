title: "The Persistent Delivery Bot"
---

Imagine a delivery robot at your front door. It doesn't know how many times it needs to ring the doorbell; it just has a simple instruction: **"WHILE nobody has opened the door, keep ringing the bell."**

It might ring once. It might ring 50 times. The robot doesn't care about a "lap count." It only cares about the **state** of the door.

In programming, a `while` loop is used when the number of repetitions is **unknown** or depends on something else happening—like a user typing a specific word, or a game character's health reaching zero.

#### For vs. While
*   **For:** "Run around the track 5 times." (Fixed number)
*   **While:** "Run around the track until you are tired." (Dynamic condition)
