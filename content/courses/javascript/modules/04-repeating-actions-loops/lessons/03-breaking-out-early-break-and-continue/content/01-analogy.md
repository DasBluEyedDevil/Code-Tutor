Imagine you are in a grocery store aisle with a list of 10 items.

1.  **The "Found It" (break):** You are looking for a specific brand of cereal. You start at one end of the aisle and check every box. As soon as you find it, you put it in your cart and **leave the aisle**. You don't need to look at the rest of the boxes because your goal is complete.
2.  **The "Skip the Bad Ones" (continue):** You are picking out 10 apples. You pick one up, but it has a bruise. You don't stop picking apples entirely; you just **skip this one** and reach for the next.

#### Why use them?
`break` and `continue` give you fine-grained control over your loops. They allow you to handle "emergency exits" or "special exceptions" without making your loop condition too complicated.
