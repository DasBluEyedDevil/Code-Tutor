Imagine a track coach watching a runner do laps. The coach has three main rules:

1.  **Start:** "You begin at lap 0."
2.  **Stop:** "You keep running as long as your lap count is **less than** 10."
3.  **Step:** "After every lap, add 1 to your count."

In programming, this is a **for loop**. It is designed for situations where you know **exactly how many times** you want to repeat an action. 

#### Why bother?
Imagine you need to print "Hello" 100 times. 
*   **Without a loop:** You have to write 100 lines of `console.log`.
*   **With a loop:** You write three lines of code and tell the computer: "Do this 100 times."

Loops are how we handle large amounts of data efficiently. Whether you're processing 100 user profiles or 1 million search results, the code is almost exactly the same.
