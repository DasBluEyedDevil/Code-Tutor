Imagine you're filling a bathtub. You don't know EXACTLY how many seconds it will take - you just know you need to keep the water running WHILE the tub is not full.

Every few seconds you check: 'Is it full yet?' No → keep filling. 'Is it full yet?' No → keep filling. 'Is it full yet?' YES → turn off the water!

This is what a 'while loop' does. Unlike a for loop (where you know how many times to repeat), a while loop keeps going UNTIL a condition becomes false. You don't know how many times it will run - you just know the condition that needs to be met to stop.
