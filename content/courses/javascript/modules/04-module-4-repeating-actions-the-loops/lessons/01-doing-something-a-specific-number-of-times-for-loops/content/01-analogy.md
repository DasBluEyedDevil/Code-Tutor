Imagine you're a teacher taking attendance. You have a list of 25 students, and you need to call out each name, one by one:

'Student 1: Are you here?'
'Student 2: Are you here?'
'Student 3: Are you here?'
...and so on until student 25.

You're doing the SAME action 25 times, just changing the number. This is tedious to write out, but perfect for a loop!

A 'for loop' is like saying: 'Start at 1, keep going until 25, and for each number, do this action.' The loop handles the counting automatically - you just tell it what to do each time.
