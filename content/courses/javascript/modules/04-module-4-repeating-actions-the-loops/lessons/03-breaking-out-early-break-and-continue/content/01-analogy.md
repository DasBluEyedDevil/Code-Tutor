Imagine you're looking through a stack of 100 papers for a specific document:

**break**: You find the document on paper #37. You don't need to look through the remaining 63 papers - you STOP immediately and leave. That's what 'break' does - it exits the loop early.

**continue**: You're reading through papers, but whenever you see a blank page, you skip it and go to the next one without processing it. That's what 'continue' does - it skips to the next iteration of the loop.

Both are useful for making loops more efficient and handling special cases.
