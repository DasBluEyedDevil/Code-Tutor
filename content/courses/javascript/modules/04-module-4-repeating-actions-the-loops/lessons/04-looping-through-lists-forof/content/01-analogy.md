Imagine you have a playlist of songs, and you want to play each one in order. You don't care about the position (song #1, song #2, etc.) - you just want to go through each song:

'Play song: Song A'
'Play song: Song B'
'Play song: Song C'

You're iterating through the LIST, not counting numbers. This is perfect for the 'for...of' loop - it's designed specifically for going through each item in a list (array) without worrying about indices or counters.
