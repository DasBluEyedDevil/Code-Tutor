Imagine you're working at a chocolate factory. A conveyor belt is moving a series of chocolates toward you. You don't care about the chocolate's "ID number" or what position it holds on the belt; you just need to pick up **each one** and put it in a box.

In programming, when we have a collection of items (like a list of usernames or a list of prices), we call it an **Array**.

The `for...of` loop is like that conveyor belt. It automatically hands you the next item in the list, one at a time, until the list is empty. You don't have to keep track of a counter like `i = 0` or check if you've reached the end of the list. JavaScript handles all the "machinery" for you.

#### Why use it?
It's much cleaner and easier to read than a standard `for` loop. It says exactly what it's doing: **"For every ITEM of this LIST, do this."**
