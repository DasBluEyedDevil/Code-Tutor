Imagine your house has a doorbell:

Passive House (no doorbell):
- Visitors knock
- You don't hear them
- Nothing happens
- Frustrating for visitors!

Active House (with doorbell):
- Doorbell LISTENS for button press
- Visitor presses button
- Doorbell RESPONDS by ringing
- You REACT by answering the door

React events work the same way:
- Components LISTEN for events (onClick, onChange, etc.)
- User performs action (click, type, submit)
- Event handler RESPONDS
- Component state updates → UI re-renders

Without event listeners → Your UI can't respond to users!
