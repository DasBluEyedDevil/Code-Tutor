Imagine hiring a contractor to build a house:

Without a Contract (JavaScript):
- 'Build me a house'
- Contractor might forget the roof
- Wrong number of rooms?
- No way to verify until it's built

With a Contract (TypeScript):
- 'Build a house with: 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a garage'
- Contractor MUST follow the contract
- Caught immediately if something's missing
- Both parties know exactly what to expect

TypeScript + React:
- **Props interface** = Contract for component inputs
- **State types** = Contract for component data
- **Return types** = Contract for what component renders

IDE catches errors BEFORE you run the app!
