Building a full-stack app is like building a house:

Foundation (Database - Prisma/PostgreSQL):
- Permanent storage for all data
- Structured (schema)
- Reliable

Plumbing & Electrical (Backend - Hono):
- Hidden from view
- Does the real work
- Connects everything together

Interior & Facade (Frontend - React):
- What users see and interact with
- Beautiful and intuitive
- Makes requests to backend for functionality

Inspector (CORS):
- Ensures everything is safe and connected properly
- Allows frontend and backend to communicate

A complete full-stack app needs ALL these parts working together!
