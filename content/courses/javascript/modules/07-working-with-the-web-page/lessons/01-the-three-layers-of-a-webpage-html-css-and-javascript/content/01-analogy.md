Imagine you are watching a play at a theater. 

1.  **HTML (The Props and Script):** This is the physical stuff on stage. The chairs, the tables, the background scenery, and the actual words the actor says. Without HTML, there is no "content"—the stage is just empty space.
2.  **CSS (The Costumes and Lighting):** This is how everything looks. The actor's red coat, the dim blue lighting for a night scene, the font style of the program. CSS doesn't change *what* is on stage, but it drastically changes the **mood and presentation**.
3.  **JavaScript (The Performance):** This is the action. When the actor walks across the stage, when the lights flicker on cue, when the curtain rises. JavaScript is the "Director" that tells the HTML and CSS when and how to change.

#### The Separation of Concerns
In professional web development, we try to keep these three layers separate. We don't want the script (HTML) to contain instructions on what color the actor's socks should be (CSS), and we don't want the lighting technician (CSS) to be responsible for reading the lines. Keeping them separate makes the whole production much easier to manage!
