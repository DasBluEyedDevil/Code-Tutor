Imagine you live in an old house built in the 1920s. You want to modernize it, but you don't want to move out while you're doing it.

1.  **Phase 1 (The Planning):** You start by just looking at the house. You haven't changed anything yet, but you're mapping out where the new electrical wires should go. (This is adding a `tsconfig.json` with `allowJs: true`).
2.  **Phase 2 (Room by Room):** You renovate the kitchen first. You rip out the old wallpaper and put in modern appliances. The rest of the house is still old, and that's okay. (This is renaming one `.js` file to `.ts` and adding types).
3.  **Phase 3 (The Final Inspector):** Once every room is done, you call in the inspector to verify that everything meets the modern safety code. (This is turning on `strict: true` once your migration is complete).

Migrating to TypeScript is a marathon, not a sprint. You don't have to rewrite your entire app in one weekend. TypeScript is designed to "live" alongside JavaScript during the transition.
