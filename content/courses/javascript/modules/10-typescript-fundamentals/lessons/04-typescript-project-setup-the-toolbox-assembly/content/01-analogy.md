Imagine you are opening a custom car factory.

1.  **The Assembly Machine (`tsc`):** You need the actual machine that takes raw metal (TypeScript) and turns it into a finished car (JavaScript).
2.  **The Instruction Manual (`tsconfig.json`):** You need to tell the machine exactly how to work. "How strict should the safety checks be?" "Should the finished car be a manual or an automatic?" "Where should the finished cars be stored?"
3.  **The Parts Bin (`node_modules`):** You need a place to store all the pre-made parts (libraries) you'll be using, like tires or engines.

Setting up a TypeScript project is the process of assembling this factory. Once the factory is set up, you can stop worrying about the machinery and focus on designing great cars.
