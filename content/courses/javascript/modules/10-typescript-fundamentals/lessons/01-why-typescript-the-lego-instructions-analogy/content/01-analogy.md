Imagine you're building a massive skyscraper.

1.  **Plain JavaScript (The Freeform Method):** You start stacking bricks. You don't have a formal blueprint. If you accidentally try to install a window where a door should be, nobody stops you. You only realize the mistake when someone tries to walk through the "door" and hits a glass pane. This is **Dynamic Typing**—mistakes are found at "Runtime" (when the building is in use).
2.  **TypeScript (The Blueprint Method):** Before you lay a single brick, you create a detailed architectural blueprint. If the blueprint says "Door goes here," and you try to bring a window to that spot, the site manager immediately says, "No, that doesn't fit!" You haven't even finished the building yet, but the error is already fixed. This is **Static Typing**—mistakes are found at "Compile Time" (before the code even runs).

TypeScript doesn't change *how* JavaScript works; it just adds a layer of strict "rules" on top of it. Once your blueprints are verified, TypeScript "disappears" and your code is turned back into plain JavaScript for the browser to run.
