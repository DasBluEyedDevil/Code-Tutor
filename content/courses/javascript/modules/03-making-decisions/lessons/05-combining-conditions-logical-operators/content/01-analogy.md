Imagine you're hiring a new team member. Depending on the role, you have different hiring rules:

1.  **The "All-Star" (AND - `&&`):** "We will only hire you if you have 5 years experience **AND** you pass the coding test." If you fail even one of these, you don't get the job. Both conditions must be **True**.
2.  **The "Emergency Hire" (OR - `||`):** "We need someone immediately! We will hire you if you have a degree **OR** you have 10 years of experience." If either one is true, you're in. Even if you have both, you're in. It only fails if **both** are false.
3.  **The "Opposite Day" (NOT - `!`):** "We will hire you if you are **NOT** a competitor." It simply takes a condition and flips it.

#### Why use them?
Logical operators allow us to group complex decisions into a single `if` statement. Instead of writing three `if` statements inside each other, we can combine them into one clean sentence.
