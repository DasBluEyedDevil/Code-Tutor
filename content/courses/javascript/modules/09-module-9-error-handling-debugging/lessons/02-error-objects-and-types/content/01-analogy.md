Imagine you're driving a modern car. When something goes wrong, you don't just see a generic "Help" light. You get specific icons:

*   **The Gas Pump:** You're out of fuel.
*   **The Thermometer:** Your engine is overheating.
*   **The Tire:** Your tire pressure is low.

Each light tells you exactly **where** the problem is so you can fix it. If the gas light is on, you go to a gas station. If the engine light is on, you pull over and call a tow truck.

JavaScript's **Error Types** are your dashboard lights. Instead of one generic "Error," JavaScript gives you specific types like `ReferenceError` or `TypeError`. By looking at the *type* of error, your code can decide how to fix it—or at least how to explain it to the user.
