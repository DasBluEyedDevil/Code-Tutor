When you visit a doctor, they don't just say 'you're sick' - they give you a specific diagnosis. 'You have the flu' is much more useful than 'something's wrong.' The diagnosis tells you what's wrong, how serious it is, and what treatment you need.

JavaScript errors work the same way. Instead of just saying 'error occurred,' JavaScript provides specific error types that act like medical diagnoses. A TypeError tells you that you tried to use a value in a way that doesn't match its type - like trying to call a number as if it were a function. A ReferenceError means you're trying to use a variable that doesn't exist - like asking for patient records that were never created.

Each error type carries specific information: a name (the diagnosis), a message (what specifically went wrong), and a stack trace (the path that led to the problem, like a patient's medical history). Understanding these error types helps you diagnose problems faster and write more targeted error handling - just like how knowing the difference between a cold and the flu helps you choose the right treatment.
