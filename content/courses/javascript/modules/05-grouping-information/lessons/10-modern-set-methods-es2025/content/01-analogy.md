Remember Sets from math class? A Set is a collection where every item is unique - no duplicates allowed!

Think of it like a VIP guest list where each person can only be listed once. If you try to add 'Alice' twice, she's still only on the list once.

ES2025 introduces powerful new Set methods that let you combine, compare, and manipulate Sets - just like Venn diagrams!

**New Set Methods:**
- **union()** - Combine two sets (everyone in EITHER set)
- **intersection()** - Find common items (everyone in BOTH sets)
- **difference()** - Find what's unique to one set (in A but NOT in B)
- **symmetricDifference()** - Find what's unique to either (in A OR B, but not both)
- **isSubsetOf()** - Check if one set contains all items of another
- **isSupersetOf()** - Check if set contains all items of another set
- **isDisjointFrom()** - Check if sets have no common items
