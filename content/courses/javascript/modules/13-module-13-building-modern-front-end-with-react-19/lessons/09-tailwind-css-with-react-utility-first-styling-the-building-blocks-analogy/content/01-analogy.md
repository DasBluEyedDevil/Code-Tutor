Imagine building with LEGO:

Traditional CSS (Custom Bricks):
- Design and manufacture each brick yourself
- 'button-primary.css' with 20 properties
- Change requires modifying the mold
- Lots of unused bricks sitting around

Tailwind CSS (Standard LEGO Bricks):
- Pre-made bricks in all sizes and colors
- Combine small pieces: 'bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded'
- Want a change? Swap a brick!
- Only bricks you use are in the final box

Tailwind = Utility classes that do ONE thing each:
- bg-blue-500 → background: blue
- text-white → color: white
- px-4 → padding-left/right: 1rem
- rounded → border-radius

No more writing custom CSS for every component!
