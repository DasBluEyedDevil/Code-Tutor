Create a `Counter` object with:\n   - state: { count: 0 }\n   - setCount(newValue) method that updates count and logs it\n   - increment() method that calls setCount with count + 1\n   - decrement() method that calls setCount with count - 1\n   - reset() method that calls setCount with 0\n\n2. Test all methods and log the count after each operation",
