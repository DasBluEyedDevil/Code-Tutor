Think of React components like LEGO blocks:

Basic LEGO block:
- Standard shape and size
- Can connect to other blocks
- Reusable - use the same piece many times
- Different colors (props) make each one unique

Custom LEGO creation (component):
- Build a car from blocks
- Want 5 cars? Use the same design 5 times
- Each car can be different color (props)
- Change the design once → All cars update

React components are reusable building blocks:
- Define once, use many times
- Pass props to customize each instance
- Compose small components into bigger ones!
