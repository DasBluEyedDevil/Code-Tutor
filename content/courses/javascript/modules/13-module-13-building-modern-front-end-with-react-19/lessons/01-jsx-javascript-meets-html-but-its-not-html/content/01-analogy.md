Imagine writing a recipe:

Plain text recipe:
- Hard to read
- No structure
- Easy to mess up

Formatted recipe with sections:
- Ingredients (like HTML tags)
- Instructions (like JavaScript logic)
- Combined in one document

JSX is like having ingredients AND instructions in one file:
- Looks like HTML (familiar and readable)
- But it's actually JavaScript (gets compiled)
- Can use JavaScript expressions inside {}

JSX = JavaScript XML. It's JavaScript that LOOKS like HTML!
