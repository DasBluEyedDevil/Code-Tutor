Imagine you have two ways to give someone your address:

**Long form**: 'My address is 123 Main Street, New York, NY 10001'

**Short form**: '123 Main St, NYC'

Both give the same information, but the short form is quicker for simple cases. Arrow functions (=>) are the 'short form' for writing functions in modern JavaScript. They do the same thing as regular functions, but with less typing for simple cases.
