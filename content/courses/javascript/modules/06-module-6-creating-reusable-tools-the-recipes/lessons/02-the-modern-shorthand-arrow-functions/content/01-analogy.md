Think back to algebra class. You might have seen a formula like:
`f(x) = x * 2`

This is a very direct way of saying: "Take an input `x`, then map it to `x` times 2." There's no extra fluff like the word "function" or "return"—just the input and the result.

**Arrow Functions** are JavaScript's way of writing code that looks like a mathematical formula. They were introduced in 2015 (ES6) to make code cleaner, especially when passing small functions into other parts of your app (like we saw with `map` and `filter`).

#### Why the "Arrow"?
The `=>` symbol is literally an arrow pointing from the **input** to the **action**.
`input => action`
It’s a visual reminder that data flows into the function and a result flows out.
