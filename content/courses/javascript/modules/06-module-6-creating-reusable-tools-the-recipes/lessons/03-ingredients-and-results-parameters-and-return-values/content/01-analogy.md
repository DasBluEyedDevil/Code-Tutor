A coffee machine is a perfect analogy for functions with parameters and return values:

**Inputs (Parameters)**: You put in coffee beans, water, and select a size
**Process**: The machine does its work inside (you don't see this)
**Output (Return Value)**: You get a cup of coffee

Similarly, a function:
- Takes INPUTS (parameters)
- Does some PROCESSING (the function body)
- Gives back an OUTPUT (return value)

Just like you can put different beans in the coffee machine and get different coffee, you can pass different parameters to a function and get different results.
