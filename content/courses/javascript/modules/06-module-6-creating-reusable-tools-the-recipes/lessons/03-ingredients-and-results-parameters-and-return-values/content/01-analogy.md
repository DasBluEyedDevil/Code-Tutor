Imagine you're working with a math tutor. You give them two numbers and ask, "What is the sum of these?"

1.  **The Input (Parameters):** You hand the tutor the numbers 5 and 10. These are the "ingredients" the tutor needs to do their job.
2.  **The Work (Function Body):** The tutor does the math in their head. You don't see the neurons firing, but you know work is happening.
3.  **The Output (Return Value):** The tutor says, "The answer is 15." 

Crucially, **the tutor's job is over now.** They've given you the answer, and now you can choose what to do with it. You might write it down in a notebook, or you might use it to solve another problem. 

In programming, `return` is how a function "hands back" an answer to the rest of the code. Without a `return`, the function might do some work, but the rest of your program will never know the result.
