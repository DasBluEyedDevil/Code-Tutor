Imagine you have a high-end coffee machine. To get a cup of coffee, you don't need to know how to grind beans, heat water to exactly 200°F, or create 9 bars of pressure. You just press a button labeled **"Make Coffee."**

In programming, this button is a **Function**. 

A function is a packaged block of code that performs a specific task. You "define" the function once (building the machine), and then you "call" it as many times as you want (pressing the button).

#### Why use Functions?
1.  **Reusability:** If you need to calculate sales tax in 50 different places in your app, you don't want to write the math 50 times. You write one `calculateTax` function and reuse it.
2.  **Organization:** Instead of one giant wall of 1,000 lines of code, you can break your program into small, manageable pieces like `checkLogin`, `updateInventory`, and `sendEmail`.
3.  **The DRY Principle:** Professional developers follow the rule: **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself. If you find yourself copying and pasting code, it's time to make a function!
