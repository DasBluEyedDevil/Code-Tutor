A recipe is a list of instructions for making a specific dish. Once you write the recipe down, you can use it over and over without rewriting the steps each time.

A function in programming is exactly like a recipe:
- It has a NAME (e.g., 'Make Pancakes')
- It has INGREDIENTS (inputs, called 'parameters')
- It has INSTRUCTIONS (the code inside)
- It produces a RESULT (output, called a 'return value')

Just like you can call out 'Make Pancakes!' and the recipe executes, in code you can 'call' a function and it executes its instructions. Functions let you avoid repeating the same code - write once, use many times!
