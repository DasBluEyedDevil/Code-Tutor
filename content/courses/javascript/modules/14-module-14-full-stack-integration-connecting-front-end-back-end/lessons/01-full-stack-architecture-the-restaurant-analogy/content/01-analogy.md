A restaurant has three main areas:

Dining Room (Front-End - React):
- Where customers sit and interact
- Beautiful presentation, easy to use
- Menus, ordering interface, displays

Kitchen (Back-End - Node.js/Hono):
- Where the real work happens
- Receives orders, processes them
- Business logic, data processing

Storage Room (Database - Prisma/PostgreSQL):
- Where ingredients are stored
- Organized, persistent, reliable
- Data that survives shutdowns

Waiter (API):
- Carries messages between dining room and kitchen
- Takes orders from customers to chefs
- Brings food from kitchen to customers

Full-stack development means building ALL THREE parts and making them work together seamlessly!
