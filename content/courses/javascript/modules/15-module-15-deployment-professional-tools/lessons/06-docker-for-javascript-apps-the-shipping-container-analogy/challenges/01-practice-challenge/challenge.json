Create a DockerImage class that:\n   - Has layers array (each instruction adds a layer)\n   - Has addLayer(instruction, size) method\n   - Has build() method that shows total size\n\n2. Create a DockerContainer class that:\n   - Takes an image to run\n   - Has start(), stop(), and status() methods\n   - Tracks environment variables\n\n3. Demonstrate multi-stage build concept by creating:\n   - A 'build' image with dev dependencies\n   - A 'production' image with only runtime files",
