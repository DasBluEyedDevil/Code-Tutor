Imagine writing a book:

Without version control:
- Save as: book_final.docx
- Save as: book_final_v2.docx
- Save as: book_final_v2_ACTUALLY_FINAL.docx
- Save as: book_final_v2_ACTUALLY_FINAL_fixed.docx
- Which one is the real final version?!
- Want to go back to Tuesday's version? Good luck finding it!
- Working with co-author? Email files back and forth (nightmare!)

With Git (version control):
- One file: book.docx
- Every save creates a snapshot (commit)
- Can jump to ANY previous version instantly
- See exactly what changed and when
- Multiple authors work simultaneously
- Automatic merging of changes
- Complete history preserved forever

Git is like a time machine for your code. It tracks every change, lets you experiment safely, and makes collaboration seamless!
