Imagine a car factory assembly line:

Without automation (manual deployment):
- Workers manually check each part
- Someone forgets to test the brakes
- Defective cars reach customers
- Recalls are expensive and embarrassing
- Inconsistent quality between shifts

With assembly line automation (CI/CD):
- Robots test EVERY car automatically
- Defects caught before shipping
- Consistent quality every time
- Faster production
- Workers focus on improvements, not repetitive checks

CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment):
- CI: Automatically test every code change
- CD: Automatically deploy when tests pass
- GitHub Actions: The robots that run your pipeline

With Bun, your CI/CD is FAST:
- bun install: 10x faster than npm
- bun test: Native test runner, blazing speed
- Less waiting = more shipping

Every push triggers: Install → Test → Build → Deploy
No manual steps, no forgotten tests, no broken deployments!
