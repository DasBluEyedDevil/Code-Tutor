Create a schema object with three models:\n   - Author (id, name, books array)\n   - Book (id, title, authorId, author)\n   - Category (id, name, books array)\n2. Set up a one-to-many relation: Author → Books\n3. Set up a many-to-many relation: Books ↔ Categories\n4. Create sample data showing:\n   - One author with multiple books\n   - Books connected to multiple categories\n5. Create a function `getAuthorWithBooks(authorId)` that returns author with their books\n6. Display the relational data\n\nYou're simulating Prisma's relation system!",
