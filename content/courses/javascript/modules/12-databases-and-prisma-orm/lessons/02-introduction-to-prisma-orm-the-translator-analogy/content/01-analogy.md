Imagine you're traveling in a foreign country:

Without a translator (raw SQL):
- You need to learn the local language fluently
- Every conversation requires you to form sentences carefully
- Easy to make grammar mistakes
- Different regions have different dialects (MySQL vs PostgreSQL)
- Stressful and error-prone

With a translator (Prisma ORM):
- You speak in your native language (TypeScript/JavaScript)
- Translator converts to local language (SQL)
- Translator knows all the dialects
- Type-safe: Translator stops you from saying nonsense
- Confident communication!

Prisma ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a translator between your JavaScript code and your database. You write TypeScript, Prisma generates the SQL!
