Imagine an assembly line in a factory. Raw materials come in one end, and finished products come out the other. Along the way, workers filter out defective items, transform parts, and count how many pass through.

Iterator helpers are like adding built-in stations to this assembly line. Instead of collecting ALL items into an array first (expensive!), you process them one at a time as they flow through. This is called 'lazy evaluation' - work happens only when needed.
