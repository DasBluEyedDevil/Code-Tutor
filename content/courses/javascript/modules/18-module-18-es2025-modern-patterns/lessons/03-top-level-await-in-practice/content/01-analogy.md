Before a restaurant opens, the chef needs ingredients. The waiters need menus. The host needs the reservation book. Everyone waits until everything is ready - THEN the doors open.

Top-level await is your pre-opening checklist. Load config, connect to database, verify dependencies - all before your app starts accepting requests.
