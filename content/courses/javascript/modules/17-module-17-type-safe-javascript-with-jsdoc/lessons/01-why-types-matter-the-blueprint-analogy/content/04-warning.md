1. **"Types slow me down"** - Types slow you down for 10 seconds while saving you hours of debugging.

2. **"JavaScript is supposed to be flexible"** - Types don't remove flexibility, they document your intentions.

3. **"I'll just write tests instead"** - Types catch bugs BEFORE tests run. Use both.
