Every shipping box has labels: 'FRAGILE', 'THIS SIDE UP', 'CONTENTS: Electronics'. Without labels, the delivery person has to guess.

JSDoc tags are your labels. `@param` says 'this box contains a string'. `@returns` says 'you'll get back a number'. Anyone handling your code knows exactly what to expect.
