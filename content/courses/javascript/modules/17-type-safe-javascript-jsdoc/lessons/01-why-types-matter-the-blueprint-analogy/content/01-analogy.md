Imagine building a house without blueprints. The electrician runs wires where they think outlets should go. The plumber puts pipes wherever is convenient. When the drywall goes up, half the outlets are in the wrong places and pipes cross where they shouldn't.

Dynamic typing in JavaScript is like building without blueprints. Everything MIGHT work, but you won't find out until the house is built (or your app is in production).

Types are your blueprints. They catch mistakes before anyone starts building.
