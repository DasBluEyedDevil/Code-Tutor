JSDoc types give you:

1. **Autocomplete**: Your IDE knows what methods are available
2. **Inline Documentation**: Hover over any function to see what it does
3. **Error Detection**: Red squiggles appear BEFORE you run the code
4. **Refactoring Safety**: Rename a property and find all usages instantly

And the best part? It's just JavaScript. No build step, no compilation, no new syntax to learn.
