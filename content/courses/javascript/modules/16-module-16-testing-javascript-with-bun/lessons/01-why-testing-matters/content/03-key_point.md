TDD flips the script: write tests BEFORE code.

1. **Red** - Write a failing test for the feature you want
2. **Green** - Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor** - Clean up the code, tests ensure it still works

Benefits of TDD:
- Forces you to think about requirements first
- Produces testable, modular code by design
- Builds a safety net as you code
- Prevents over-engineering (only write what's needed)

Start small: write one test, make it pass, repeat.
