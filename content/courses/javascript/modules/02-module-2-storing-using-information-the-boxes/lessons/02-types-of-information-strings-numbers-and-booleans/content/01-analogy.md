Just like in real life, we store different TYPES of things in different ways:

- Words and sentences: We write them down as text (String)
- Counting and measuring: We use numbers (Number)
- Yes/No questions: We use true or false (Boolean)

JavaScript has different 'types' of data for the same reason. Each type works differently and has different things you can do with it.

Think of it like different types of storage containers:
- A filing cabinet is for documents (text/strings)
- A scale is for numbers (you can add, subtract, compare)
- A light switch is for true/false (on or off, yes or no)

You wouldn't try to do math with words, and you wouldn't try to write a letter with numbers. JavaScript keeps track of what TYPE each variable is so it knows how to work with it.
