*   **Strings** are text and can be defined with `' '`, `" "`, or `` ` ` ``.
*   **Template Literals** (`` `...${var}...` ``) are the best way to combine variables and text.
*   **Numbers** can be integers or decimals.
*   **Booleans** are strictly `true` or `false`.
*   `undefined` means a variable has no value yet.
*   `null` is an intentional "empty" value.
*   Be careful when mixing types (like adding numbers to strings).
