*   **Variables** are labeled storage boxes for data.
*   **`const`** is for values that **do not change** (constants). Use this by default.
*   **`let`** is for values that **can change** (variables).
*   **Assignment**: Use `=` to put a value into a variable (e.g., `let x = 5`).
*   **Reassignment**: Use variable name without `let` to change it (e.g., `x = 10`).
*   **`var`**: Avoid using this older keyword.
