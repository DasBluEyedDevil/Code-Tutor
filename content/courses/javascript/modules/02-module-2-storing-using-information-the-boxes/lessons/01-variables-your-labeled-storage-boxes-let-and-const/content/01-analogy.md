Imagine you have a storage room with many boxes. Each box can hold one thing, and you put a label on each box so you remember what's inside.

'Age: 25' - A box labeled 'Age' that contains the number 25
'Name: Alice' - A box labeled 'Name' that contains the text 'Alice'
'Is Student: true' - A box labeled 'Is Student' that contains the answer 'yes' (true)

In programming, these labeled boxes are called VARIABLES. A variable is just a named container that holds a piece of information. You create a variable, give it a name (the label), and store something in it (the contents).

Why are variables useful? Because you can create a box once and then use what's inside it many times throughout your code. If you need to change what's in the box, you change it in ONE place, and everywhere that uses that box automatically gets the new value.
