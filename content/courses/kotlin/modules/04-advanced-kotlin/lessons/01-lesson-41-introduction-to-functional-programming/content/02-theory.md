Welcome to Part 3: Functional Programming! You've mastered Kotlin basics and object-oriented programming. Now it's time to explore a powerful programming paradigm that will transform how you write code.

Functional programming (FP) is not just about using functions—it's a different way of thinking about problems. Instead of telling the computer **what to do** step-by-step (imperative), you describe **what you want** (declarative). The result? Code that's shorter, clearer, and easier to test.

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- What functional programming really means
- First-class and higher-order functions
- Lambda expressions basics
- Function types in Kotlin
- How to pass functions as parameters

By the end, you'll write elegant, functional code that reads like English!
