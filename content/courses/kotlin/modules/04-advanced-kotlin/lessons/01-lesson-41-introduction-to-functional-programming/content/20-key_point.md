**Functional Programming Benefits**:
- More concise code
- Easier to test (pure functions)
- Better composability
- Natural parallelization
- Reduced bugs from mutable state

**When to Use Functional Style**:
- ✅ Data transformations (map, filter, reduce)
- ✅ Event handling
- ✅ Configuration and customization
- ✅ Collections processing
- ❌ Performance-critical tight loops (sometimes)
- ❌ State machines with complex mutable state

**Remember**:
- Functions are values—treat them as such
- Higher-order functions enable powerful abstractions
- Lambdas make functional code concise
- Start thinking "what" instead of "how"
