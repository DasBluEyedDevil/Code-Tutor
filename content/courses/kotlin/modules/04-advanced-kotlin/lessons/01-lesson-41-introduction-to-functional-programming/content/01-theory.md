**Estimated Time**: 60 minutes
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Prerequisites**: Parts 1-2 (Kotlin fundamentals, OOP)

Welcome to Part 3: Advanced Kotlin! You've mastered the fundamentals and Object-Oriented Programming. Now it's time to explore **Functional Programming (FP)**, a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.

Kotlin is a multi-paradigm language, which means you can seamlessly blend OOP and FP to write cleaner, more expressive code. In this lesson, you'll discover:

1. **First-class functions**: Functions as values you can pass around like data
2. **Pure functions**: Functions without side effects that always produce the same output for the same input
3. **Immutability**: Data that doesn't change, making code easier to reason about
4. **Higher-order functions**: Functions that take or return other functions

By the end of this lesson, you'll understand why functional programming matters and how Kotlin makes it natural and enjoyable.
