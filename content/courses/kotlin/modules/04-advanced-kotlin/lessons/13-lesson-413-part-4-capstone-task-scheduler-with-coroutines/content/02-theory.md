Congratulations on completing all the lessons in Part 4! You've learned the most advanced features of Kotlin:

- ✅ Generics and type parameters
- ✅ Coroutines fundamentals
- ✅ Advanced coroutines (Flows, Channels, StateFlow)
- ✅ Delegation and lazy initialization
- ✅ Annotations and reflection
- ✅ DSLs and type-safe builders

Now it's time to put it all together in a **comprehensive capstone project**: a **Task Scheduler with Coroutines**.

This project will challenge you to apply all advanced concepts in a real-world scenario where you build a sophisticated task scheduling system with async execution, monitoring, and configuration.
