**Estimated Time**: 4-5 hours
**Difficulty**: Advanced
**Prerequisites**: All Part 4 lessons

Welcome to the Part 4 Capstone! This is the most ambitious project yet, combining everything you've learned about advanced Kotlin into a **Task Scheduler with Coroutines**.

You'll build a production-quality task scheduling system that demonstrates:

**Functional Programming**:
- Higher-order functions for task configuration
- Lambda expressions for task actions
- Function composition for pipelines

**Generics & Type Safety**:
- Type-safe task definitions
- Generic result handling

**Coroutines & Concurrency**:
- Concurrent task execution
- Structured concurrency for task groups
- Cancellation and timeout handling
- Progress reporting with Flows

**Architecture**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- DSL for task configuration
- Extensible scheduler design

This capstone simulates real-world async processing scenarios like job queues, scheduled tasks, and workflow engines.

Let's build something truly advanced!
