**The Task Scheduler capstone integrates advanced Kotlin features**—coroutines for concurrency, generics for type safety, delegation for clean architecture, and DSLs for intuitive scheduling APIs.

**Real-world schedulers balance competing constraints**: fairness, priority, resource limits, and cancellation semantics. This project demonstrates the architectural decisions required for production async systems.

**You've completed Advanced Kotlin**—you now have the tools to write sophisticated, concurrent, type-safe applications using professional Kotlin patterns used in production codebases.
