You've learned functional programming basics, lambdas, collections, and scope functions. Now it's time to explore advanced functional techniques that enable powerful abstractions.

Function composition and currying are techniques that let you build complex functionality from simple building blocks. They're the foundation of elegant, reusable code.

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- Function composition (combining functions)
- Currying and partial application
- Extension functions as functional tools
- Infix functions for readable code
- Operator overloading
- Building domain-specific languages (DSLs)

By the end, you'll create expressive, composable APIs!
