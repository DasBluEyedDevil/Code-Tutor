Scope functions are one of Kotlin's most distinctive features. They're small but incredibly powerful—enabling you to write cleaner, more expressive code.

At first glance, `let`, `run`, `with`, `apply`, and `also` might seem similar. But each has a specific purpose, and mastering them will make your code more idiomatic and elegant.

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- What scope functions are and why they exist
- The five scope functions: let, run, with, apply, also
- When to use each one
- The difference between `this` and `it` context
- Return value differences
- Chaining scope functions
- Real-world use cases

By the end, you'll write fluent, readable Kotlin code!
