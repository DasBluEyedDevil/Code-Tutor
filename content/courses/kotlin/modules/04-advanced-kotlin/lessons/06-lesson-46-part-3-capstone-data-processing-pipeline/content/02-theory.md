Congratulations on reaching the capstone project! You've learned functional programming from the ground up—lambdas, higher-order functions, collection operations, scope functions, composition, and currying.

Now it's time to apply everything to a real-world project: a **Data Processing Pipeline** that analyzes sales data.

### What You'll Build

A complete functional data processing system that:
- Reads and parses CSV data
- Cleans and validates data
- Transforms and enriches data
- Aggregates statistics
- Generates reports
- Uses functional programming throughout

### Skills You'll Practice

✅ Collection operations (map, filter, groupBy, etc.)
✅ Higher-order functions
✅ Function composition
✅ Scope functions
✅ Extension functions
✅ Sequences for performance
✅ Functional pipelines
✅ Error handling functionally
