**Functional pipelines chain transformations into readable data flows**. Operations like `filter`, `map`, `groupBy`, and `reduce` compose naturally to process complex data without explicit loops or temporary variables.

**Each pipeline stage should have a single, clear responsibility**. This separation of concerns makes pipelines easier to test, debug, and extend—you can add or remove stages without affecting others.

**This capstone demonstrates functional programming in practice**—transforming real-world data through pure functions that are predictable, testable, and composable.
