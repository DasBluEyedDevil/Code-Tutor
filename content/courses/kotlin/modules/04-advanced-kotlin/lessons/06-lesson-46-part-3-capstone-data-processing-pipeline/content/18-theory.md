**You've Built a Complete Functional Application!**

This capstone project demonstrates that functional programming isn't just academic—it's practical and powerful for real-world applications.

**Key Lessons**:
1. **Composition**: Small functions → Complex operations
2. **Immutability**: Safer, easier to reason about
3. **Declarative**: Expresses *what*, not *how*
4. **Reusability**: Functions as building blocks
5. **Testability**: Pure functions are easy to test

**Next Steps**:
- Add features from the extension challenges
- Apply FP principles to your own projects
- Explore Arrow library for advanced FP in Kotlin
- Practice composing functions daily
