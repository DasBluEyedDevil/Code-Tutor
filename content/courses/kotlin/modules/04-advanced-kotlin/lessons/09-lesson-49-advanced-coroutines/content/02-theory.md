Now that you understand coroutine basics, it's time to explore the advanced features that make coroutines truly powerful. These features enable you to build reactive systems, handle streams of data, communicate between coroutines, and gracefully handle errors in concurrent code.

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- Structured concurrency patterns
- Exception handling in coroutines
- Flows for reactive streams
- Channels for coroutine communication
- StateFlow and SharedFlow for state management
- `withContext` for context switching
- Advanced dispatchers and supervisors

By the end, you'll build production-ready concurrent applications!
