Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) are specialized mini-languages designed for specific problem domains. Kotlin's features—especially lambda with receiver—make it perfect for creating beautiful, type-safe DSLs that feel like natural language.

You've already used DSLs if you've worked with Gradle build scripts, Ktor routing, or HTML builders. These aren't magic—they're well-designed Kotlin code that you can create yourself!

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- What DSLs are and when to use them
- Lambda with receiver syntax
- Type-safe builders pattern
- Creating HTML DSL
- Creating configuration DSL
- `@DslMarker` annotation for scope control

By the end, you'll build expressive APIs that feel like custom languages!
