**DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages) make Kotlin code read like natural language** for specific domains. Lambda receivers and operator overloading enable builders that look like custom syntax while remaining fully type-safe.

**Type-safe builders eliminate stringly-typed APIs**. Compare `html { body { h1("Title") } }` with DOM manipulation—the builder version has compile-time verification of structure and prevents invalid nesting.

**Kotlin's DSL capabilities are used by major frameworks**: Gradle build scripts, Ktor routing, Jetpack Compose UI, and Exposed SQL queries all use DSL patterns to provide expressive, type-safe APIs.
