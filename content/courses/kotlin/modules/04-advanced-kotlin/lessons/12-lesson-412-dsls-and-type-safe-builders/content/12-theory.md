Congratulations! You've mastered DSLs and type-safe builders in Kotlin. Here's what you learned:

✅ **DSLs** - Creating domain-specific languages in Kotlin
✅ **Lambda with Receiver** - Foundation of DSL syntax
✅ **Type-Safe Builders** - Hierarchical structure creation
✅ **HTML DSL** - Practical builder pattern example
✅ **Configuration DSL** - Type-safe configuration
✅ **@DslMarker** - Scope control in nested DSLs

### Key Takeaways

1. **Lambda with receiver** makes `this` implicit
2. **Type-safe builders** catch errors at compile time
3. **@DslMarker** prevents scope confusion
4. **DSLs improve readability** for complex configurations
5. **Use judiciously** - don't over-engineer simple cases

### Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll bring everything together in the **Part 4 Capstone Project** - building a complete task scheduler that uses generics, coroutines, delegation, reflection, and DSLs!

**Practice Challenge**: Create a routing DSL for a web framework with GET/POST/PUT/DELETE methods, path parameters, middleware, and type-safe request handlers.
