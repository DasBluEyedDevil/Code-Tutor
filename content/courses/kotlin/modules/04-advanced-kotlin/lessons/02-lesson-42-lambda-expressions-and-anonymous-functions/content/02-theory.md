In the previous lesson, you learned the basics of lambda expressions. Now it's time to master them completely!

Lambda expressions are everywhere in modern Kotlin code. They power collection operations, make Android development cleaner, and enable elegant APIs. Understanding lambdas deeply will make you a more effective Kotlin developer.

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- All lambda syntax variations
- The `it` keyword and when to use it
- Trailing lambda syntax
- Anonymous functions
- Function references (::)
- Member references
- When to use each approach

By the end, you'll write idiomatic Kotlin code like a pro!
