Welcome to Part 4: Advanced Kotlin Features! You've mastered the fundamentals, object-oriented programming, and functional programming. Now it's time to explore the powerful features that make Kotlin a truly modern language.

Generics are one of the most important features in Kotlin. They allow you to write flexible, reusable code that works with different types while maintaining type safety. Without generics, you'd need to write the same code multiple times for different types or lose type safety by using `Any`.

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- Generic classes and functions
- Type parameters and constraints
- Variance: `in`, `out`, and invariant types
- Reified type parameters
- Star projections
- Generic constraints with `where`

By the end, you'll write type-safe, reusable code that works with any type!
