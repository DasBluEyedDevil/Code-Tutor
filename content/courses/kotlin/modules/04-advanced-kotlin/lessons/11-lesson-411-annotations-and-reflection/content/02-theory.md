Annotations and reflection are powerful metaprogramming tools that allow you to write code that examines and modifies other code at runtime. Annotations provide metadata about your code, while reflection lets you inspect and manipulate classes, functions, and properties dynamically.

These features are essential for building frameworks, libraries, serialization systems, dependency injection containers, and testing frameworks.

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- Built-in annotations (`@JvmName`, `@JvmStatic`, `@Deprecated`, etc.)
- Creating custom annotations
- Annotation targets and retention
- Reflection basics with `KClass`, `KFunction`, `KProperty`
- Inspecting classes and members at runtime
- Practical use cases and patterns

By the end, you'll build systems that adapt dynamically at runtime!
