**Collection Operations Transform Code**:
- Replace loops with declarative operations
- Chain operations for readability
- Immutable transformations prevent bugs

**Choose the Right Tool**:
- `map`: Transform each element
- `filter`: Select elements
- `reduce/fold`: Combine into single value
- `flatMap`: Transform and flatten
- `groupBy`: Organize by key

**Performance Matters**:
- Regular collections: Small data, simple operations
- Sequences: Large data, multiple operations, partial results
- Measure when performance is critical
