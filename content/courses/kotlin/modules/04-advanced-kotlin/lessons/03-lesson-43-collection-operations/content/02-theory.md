Collections are everywhere in programming. Lists of users, sets of products, maps of configurations—they're fundamental to real applications. The way you work with collections defines your code quality.

Kotlin's collection operations transform data manipulation from verbose loops into expressive, declarative pipelines. Instead of writing "how" to process data step-by-step, you declare "what" you want.

In this lesson, you'll master:
- Essential operations: map, filter, reduce
- Finding elements: find, first, last, any, all, none
- Advanced grouping: groupBy, partition, associate
- Flattening nested structures: flatMap, flatten
- Sequences for lazy evaluation and performance

By the end, you'll process data with elegance and efficiency!
