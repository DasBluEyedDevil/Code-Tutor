Think of architecture like building a house:

**Without Architecture (Shack)**
- Build walls wherever convenient
- Plumbing goes through random places
- Electrical wires cross plumbing
- No foundation plan
- Adding a room? Tear everything down and rebuild

**With Architecture (House)**
- Foundation designed for the full structure
- Plumbing in designated areas
- Electrical separated from water
- Clear room boundaries
- Adding a room? Extend according to plan

**Software Parallels:**
- **Foundation** = Core business logic
- **Plumbing** = Data flow
- **Electrical** = UI events
- **Rooms** = Features/Modules
- **Walls** = Boundaries between concerns
