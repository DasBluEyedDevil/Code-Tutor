**Architecture is the organization of code into layers with clear responsibilities and dependencies**. Good architecture makes apps maintainable, testable, and scalable as complexity grows.

**In KMP, architecture is even more critical** because shared code must work across platforms with different lifecycle models, UI frameworks, and threading constraints. Bad architecture multiplies problems across all targets.

**The cost of poor architecture compounds over time**—initial velocity from skipping architecture decreases as every feature requires refactoring spaghetti code. Invest in architecture early to maintain long-term productivity.
