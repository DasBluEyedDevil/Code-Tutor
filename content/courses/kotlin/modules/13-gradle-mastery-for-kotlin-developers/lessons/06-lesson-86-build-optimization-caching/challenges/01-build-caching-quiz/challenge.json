  "description": "Test your understanding of Gradle build caching, incremental compilation, and optimization strategies.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "text": "What does Gradle's build cache store?",
      "options": [
        "Source code snapshots for version control",
        "Task outputs keyed by task inputs, so identical inputs skip execution",
        "Compiled classes only (not resources or generated files)",
        "Network responses from dependency downloads"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Gradle's build cache stores the outputs of each task (compiled classes, processed resources, generated files) keyed by a hash of the task's inputs. When inputs match a cache entry, the outputs are restored instead of re-executing the task."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "text": "What is the difference between a local build cache and a remote build cache?",
      "options": [
        "Local caches use SSD, remote caches use HDD",
        "Local cache is per-machine (in ~/.gradle); remote cache is shared across developers and CI via an HTTP server",
        "Local cache is for debug builds; remote cache is for release builds",
        "They are the same -- 'remote' just means a different directory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The local build cache lives on your machine (~/.gradle/caches/build-cache-1/). A remote build cache is an HTTP server (Gradle Enterprise or custom) shared by all developers and CI agents. When CI builds populate the remote cache, developer machines benefit from pre-computed results."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "text": "Why should you avoid using 'gradle clean build' as your default build command?",
      "options": [
        "It corrupts the build cache",
        "'clean' deletes all build outputs, forcing full recompilation and defeating incremental compilation and caching",
        "It is slower than 'gradle build --rerun-tasks'",
        "'clean' is deprecated in modern Gradle"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "'gradle clean' deletes the entire build directory, destroying incremental compilation state and local build cache entries. This forces a full rebuild from scratch. Use 'gradle build' alone -- Gradle's up-to-date checks and caching handle invalidation automatically."
