### The Build System

Gradle is an **automation tool** that handles:
- Compiling your code
- Running tests
- Managing dependencies
- Packaging your application
- Deploying to production

### Why Gradle?

**Flexibility**: Unlike older build tools (Maven, Ant), Gradle uses code (Kotlin or Groovy) instead of XML, making it infinitely customizable.

**Performance**: Gradle uses incremental builds, caching, and parallel execution to build faster.

**Kotlin DSL**: Since Kotlin 1.0, Gradle supports Kotlin as a first-class scripting language, giving you:
- Full IDE support (autocomplete, refactoring)
- Type safety (catch errors at compile time)
- Better documentation through types
