  "description": "Test your understanding of Kotlin Multiplatform source set configuration and hierarchy.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "text": "In a KMP project, where should platform-independent business logic be placed?",
      "options": [
        "androidMain",
        "iosMain",
        "commonMain",
        "jvmMain"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "commonMain is the shared source set that compiles for ALL target platforms. Business logic, data models, repository interfaces, and shared utilities go here. Platform-specific implementations use expect/actual declarations."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "text": "What is the purpose of an intermediate source set like 'nativeMain' in KMP?",
      "options": [
        "It replaces commonMain for native platforms",
        "It allows sharing code between native targets (iOS, macOS, Linux) without including JVM or JS",
        "It is required for all KMP projects",
        "It contains the main() function for native apps"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Intermediate source sets like nativeMain sit between commonMain and specific targets (iosArm64Main, macosArm64Main, etc.). They share code across a subset of platforms -- in this case, all Kotlin/Native targets. This avoids duplicating expect/actual for each native target."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "text": "If you declare 'expect fun platformName(): String' in commonMain, where must the 'actual' implementation go?",
      "options": [
        "In commonMain alongside the expect declaration",
        "In each platform source set (androidMain, iosMain, etc.) that the project targets",
        "Only in androidMain since Android is the primary target",
        "In a separate module called 'platform-impl'"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Every 'expect' declaration in commonMain must have a corresponding 'actual' implementation in EACH platform source set. If your project targets Android and iOS, you need actual fun platformName() in both androidMain and iosMain."
