Imagine you need to send birthday invitations to 50 friends. Would you write 50 separate print statements? Of course not! You'd use a loop to repeat the same task with different values. That's the power of iteration—doing something multiple times without writing repetitive code.

In programming, we frequently need to:
- Process every item in a list
- Repeat an action a specific number of times
- Count through a sequence of numbers
- Iterate through collections of data

Kotlin's `for` loop makes all of this elegant and easy. Unlike many languages where loops can be complex and error-prone, Kotlin's for loop is designed to be safe, concise, and expressive.

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- What iteration means and why it's essential
- How to use for loops with ranges
- Iterating through collections and lists
- Working with indices
- Advanced loop techniques: step, downTo, until
- Best practices for clean, efficient loops

By the end, you'll be able to process data efficiently and write powerful, concise code!
