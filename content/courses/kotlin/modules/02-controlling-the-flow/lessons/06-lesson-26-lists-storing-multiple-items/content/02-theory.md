So far, you've stored individual pieces of data in variables—a single name, one number, a single temperature. But real-world programs need to manage collections of related data: a shopping cart with multiple items, a class roster with dozens of students, a playlist with hundreds of songs.

Imagine creating a task manager app. Would you create separate variables for each task?


This is impractical and impossible to maintain. **Lists** solve this problem elegantly by storing multiple items in a single, ordered collection.

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- What lists are and why they're essential
- Creating immutable and mutable lists
- Accessing, adding, and removing elements
- Essential list operations and functions
- Powerful functional programming with lists
- Best practices for working with collections

By the end, you'll be able to manage collections of data like a pro!

val task1 = "Buy groceries"
val task2 = "Call dentist"
val task3 = "Finish homework"
// ... task50?
```
