You've learned how to make decisions with `if-else` statements and combine conditions with logical operators. But what happens when you need to check many different possibilities? Imagine writing a program that converts day numbers to day names, or grades to letter marks. Using `if-else` chains becomes verbose and hard to read.

Enter Kotlin's `when` expression—an elegant, powerful alternative that makes multi-way decisions clean and expressive. Think of it as a sophisticated switchboard operator, efficiently routing your program to the right destination based on various conditions.

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- What the `when` expression is and when to use it
- How to match against specific values
- Using `when` with ranges and complex conditions
- The power of `when` as an expression
- Pattern matching and smart casts
- Best practices for clean, maintainable code

By the end, you'll be able to write elegant decision logic that's both powerful and easy to understand!
