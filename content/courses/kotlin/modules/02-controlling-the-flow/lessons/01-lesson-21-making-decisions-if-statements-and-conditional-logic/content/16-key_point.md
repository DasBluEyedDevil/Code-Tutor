**Conditional logic is how programs make intelligent decisions**. Every branch in your code represents a different path based on runtime data, enabling software to respond dynamically to user input and changing conditions.

**Kotlin's `if` is an expression**, meaning it returns a value and can be assigned directly to variables. This eliminates temporary variables and aligns with functional programming principles.

**Structure your conditions from most specific to most general**. Check edge cases first, then normal cases, and finally provide a default fallback. This pattern prevents bugs and makes your logic easier to follow.
