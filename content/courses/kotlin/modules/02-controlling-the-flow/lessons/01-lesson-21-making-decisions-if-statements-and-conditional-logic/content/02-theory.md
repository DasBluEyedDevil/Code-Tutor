Welcome to Part 2: Controlling the Flow! You've mastered Kotlin fundamentals—variables, data types, functions, and basic input/output. Now it's time to make your programs **intelligent** by teaching them to make decisions.

Up until now, your programs have executed line-by-line in a straight path, like following a recipe exactly. But real-world programs need to adapt and respond to different situations. Should you bring an umbrella? **If** it's raining, yes. **Otherwise**, no. That's conditional logic!

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- What conditional logic is and why it's essential
- How to use `if`, `else`, and `else if` statements
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
- How to make decisions based on Boolean conditions
- Kotlin's unique `if` expression feature
- Common patterns and best practices

By the end, you'll write programs that adapt their behavior based on conditions—the foundation of all intelligent software!
