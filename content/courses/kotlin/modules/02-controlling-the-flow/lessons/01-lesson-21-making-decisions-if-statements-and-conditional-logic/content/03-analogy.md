### Real-World Decision Making

Every day, you make countless decisions based on conditions:




Your brain evaluates conditions and chooses different paths automatically. Programming lets computers do the same!

### The Traffic Light Analogy

Think of a traffic light controlling your program's flow:

- **Red light (condition false)**: Skip this block of code
- **Green light (condition true)**: Execute this block of code
- **Yellow light (else)**: Default path when others are false

Just as traffic lights control the flow of cars, conditional statements control the flow of code execution.

### What Makes a Condition?

A condition is any expression that evaluates to **true** or **false** (a Boolean value):


The program checks the condition and decides which code to execute based on the result.

```kotlin
age >= 18           // true if age is 18 or more
temperature < 32    // true if temperature is less than 32
name == "Alice"     // true if name exactly equals "Alice"
isRaining           // already a Boolean variable
```
