You've mastered for loops, which are perfect when you know exactly how many times to repeat something. But programming often requires a different kind of repetition—repeating until a condition is met, not a fixed number of times.

Think about real-life scenarios:
- Keep entering your password **until** it's correct
- Keep rolling dice **until** you get a six
- Keep asking for menu input **until** the user chooses "quit"
- Download data **while** there's more to download

These situations don't have a predetermined number of iterations—they continue based on a **condition**. That's where `while` and `do-while` loops shine!

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- The difference between while and do-while loops
- When to use each type of loop
- How to control loops with break and continue
- Avoiding infinite loops
- Common patterns and best practices

By the end, you'll know how to choose the right loop for any situation!
