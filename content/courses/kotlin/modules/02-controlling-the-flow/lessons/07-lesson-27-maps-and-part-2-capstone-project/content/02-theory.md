You've mastered lists—ordered collections accessed by numeric indices. But what if you need to look up data by something more meaningful than a number? What if you need to:

- Find a phone number by a person's name
- Look up a product price by its name
- Get a user's email by their username
- Translate a word from English to Spanish

You *could* use two parallel lists (one for keys, one for values), but that's clunky and error-prone. **Maps** solve this elegantly by storing **key-value pairs**—like a real-world dictionary where you look up a word (key) to find its definition (value).

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- What maps are and when to use them
- Creating immutable and mutable maps
- Accessing, adding, and removing entries
- Iterating through maps
- Common map operations
- **Part 2 Capstone Project**: Build a complete contact management system!

This is the final lesson of Part 2, so we'll finish strong with a comprehensive project that combines everything you've learned!
