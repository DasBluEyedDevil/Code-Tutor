title: "The NOT Operator (!)"
---


The NOT operator (`!`) **inverts** (flips) a Boolean value.

### Truth Table for NOT

| Condition | !Condition |
|-----------|------------|
| true | **false** |
| false | **true** |

**Think of it as:** "The opposite of..."

### Basic NOT Example


**Output:**

`isRaining` is false, so `!isRaining` becomes true, and the if block executes.

### Real-World NOT Examples

**Example 1: Checking if not equal**

**Note:** This is the same as `status != "completed"`. The `!=` operator is actually a shorthand for `!(... == ...)`.

**Example 2: Door lock check**

**Example 3: Inverting complex conditions**

**Output:**
