In the last lesson, you learned to make decisions with if statements and simple conditions. But real-world decisions often involve **multiple conditions** working together:

- "**IF** it's raining **AND** I don't have an umbrella, **THEN** I'll get wet"
- "**IF** you're under 13 **OR** over 65, **THEN** you get a discount"
- "**IF** the door is **NOT** locked, **THEN** you can enter"

Notice the words **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT**? These are **logical operators**, and they let you combine and modify conditions to create more sophisticated decision-making logic.

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- The three logical operators: AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`)
- How to combine multiple conditions
- Truth tables and how logical operators work
- Short-circuit evaluation for efficiency
- Common patterns and best practices
- How to simplify complex conditional logic

By the end, you'll write elegant code that handles complex real-world scenarios!
