### Real-World Logic

Think about these everyday decisions:

**AND logic (both must be true):**

**OR logic (at least one must be true):**

**NOT logic (invert/flip the condition):**

Programming uses these exact same patterns!

### The Three Logical Operators

| Operator | Name | Symbol | Meaning |
|----------|------|--------|---------|
| AND | Logical AND | `&&` | Both conditions must be true |
| OR | Logical OR | `\|\|` | At least one condition must be true |
| NOT | Logical NOT | `!` | Inverts/flips the condition |
