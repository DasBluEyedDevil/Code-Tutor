You've already learned the basics of functions—reusable blocks of code that help organize your program. But so far, your functions have been like vending machines that dispense the same item every time. What if you want to customize what you get?

In this lesson, you'll learn how to make your functions truly flexible and powerful by:
- **Passing data INTO functions** (parameters)
- **Getting data BACK from functions** (return values)
- **Creating reusable, customizable code blocks** that adapt to different situations

Think of it this way: A chef doesn't just make "a sandwich"—they take specific ingredients (parameters) and create a customized sandwich (return value) based on what you ordered. That's exactly what we're learning today!

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to write functions that accept input, process it, and give you back exactly what you need.
