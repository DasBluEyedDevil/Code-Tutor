In this lesson, we are going to master the most powerful aspects of functions: **Parameters and Return Values**. While you've seen the basics, here we will dive deep into how to design functions that are flexible, reusable, and professional.

You will learn:
1. How to pass multiple parameters of different types.
2. How to handle complex return values.
3. Best practices for parameter naming and documentation.
4. How to use functions to solve real-world calculation problems.

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to create "black box" functions that take complex inputs and return precise results!
