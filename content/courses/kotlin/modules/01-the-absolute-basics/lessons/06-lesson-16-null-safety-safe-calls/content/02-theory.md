One of the most common bugs in programming is the dreaded **NullPointerException** (NPE)—trying to use something that doesn't exist. It's been called the "billion-dollar mistake" by its inventor, Tony Hoare.

Kotlin solves this problem with its **null safety** system. The compiler prevents most null-related crashes at compile-time, not runtime. This lesson teaches you how to safely work with values that might not exist.
