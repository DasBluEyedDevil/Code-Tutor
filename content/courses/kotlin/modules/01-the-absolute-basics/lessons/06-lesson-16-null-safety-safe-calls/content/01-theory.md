**Estimated Time**: 55 minutes

Welcome to Lesson 1.6! One of the biggest headaches in programming is the "billion-dollar mistake"—the Null Pointer Exception (crashing because you tried to use something that doesn't exist). Kotlin was specifically designed to solve this problem.

In this lesson, you will learn:
1. **Nullable Types**: How to tell Kotlin that a variable might be empty.
2. **Safe Calls (`?.`)**: How to safely access data without crashing.
3. **The Elvis Operator (`?:`)**: How to provide a default value when something is null.
4. **The Not-Null Assertion (`!!`)**: When (and when NOT) to force-use a value.
5. **Safe Casting**: How to safely change types.

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to write "null-safe" code that is much more stable and less likely to crash!
