### The Kitchen Helper Analogy

Think of functions as kitchen helpers with specific jobs:

**Chef's Kitchen (Your Program)**:
- **Dishwasher Helper**: You give them dirty dishes → They return clean dishes
- **Prep Helper**: You give them vegetables → They return chopped vegetables
- **Baking Helper**: You give them ingredients → They return a finished cake

**Programming Functions**:

**Key Concepts**:
- **Input** (parameters): What you give the function
- **Processing**: What the function does
- **Output** (return value): What the function gives back

```kotlin
fun washDishes(dirtyDishes: List<String>): List<String> {
    // Washing logic here
    return cleanDishes
}

fun chopVegetables(vegetables: List<String>): List<String> {
    // Chopping logic here
    return choppedVegetables
}

fun bakeCake(ingredients: List<String>): Cake {
    // Baking logic here
    return finishedCake
}
```
