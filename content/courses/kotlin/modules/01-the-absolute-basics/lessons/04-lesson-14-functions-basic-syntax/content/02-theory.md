Imagine you're writing a recipe book. Instead of writing "crack 3 eggs, beat them, add milk, stir" every single time you need beaten eggs, you create a recipe called "Make Beaten Eggs" and just reference it whenever needed.

**Functions** are exactly this in programming—reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Instead of repeating the same code over and over, you write it once in a function and call it whenever you need it.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to create functions, pass data to them, get results back, and make your code more organized and maintainable.
