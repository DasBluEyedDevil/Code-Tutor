**Goal**: Create a program to manage student grades using a map.

**Starter Code**:
```kotlin
fun main() {
    val grades = mutableMapOf<String, Int>()
    // 1. Add students
    // 2. Print all
    // 3. Calculate average
    // 4. Filter grades > 80
}
```

**Expected Output**:
```text
=== Student Grade Manager ===
All Students:
  Alice: 92
  Bob: 78
  ...
Average Grade: 85.20
...
```
