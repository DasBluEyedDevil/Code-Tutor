### The Container Analogy

Think of collections as different types of containers:

**List** = Playlist
- Ordered sequence of songs
- Can have duplicates (same song twice)
- You can access by position: "Play song #3"

**Set** = Unique Badge Collection
- No duplicates allowed
- Unordered (or natural order)
- Great for checking membership: "Do I have the gold badge?"

**Map** = Dictionary
- Key-value pairs
- Look up definitions by word
- Each key is unique: "What does 'hello' mean in Spanish?"

**Array** = Fixed-size parking lot
- Fixed number of spaces
- Direct access by position
- Size cannot change after creation
