Welcome to Lesson 1.5! Until now, we've been working with single values (like one name or one age). But real-world data usually comes in groups—think of a shopping list, a set of high scores, or a map of users and their profile data.

In this lesson, you will learn:
1. **Lists**: Ordered collections of items (like a grocery list).
2. **Sets**: Unique collections where duplicates are not allowed (like a set of unique usernames).
3. **Maps**: Key-value pairs (like a dictionary or a phone book).
4. **Mutability**: The difference between read-only collections and those you can change.
5. **Collection Operations**: Powerful ways to filter, transform, and search through your data.

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to manage and manipulate complex groups of data with ease!
