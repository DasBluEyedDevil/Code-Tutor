**Goal**: Count how many times each word appears in a sentence.

**Starter Code**:
```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Enter a sentence:")
    val sentence = readln()
    
    // Hint: Use sentence.lowercase().split(" ")
    // Use a map to store counts
}
```

**Expected Output**:
```text
Enter a sentence:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The fox is quick!

=== Word Frequency ===
the: 3
quick: 2
...
```
