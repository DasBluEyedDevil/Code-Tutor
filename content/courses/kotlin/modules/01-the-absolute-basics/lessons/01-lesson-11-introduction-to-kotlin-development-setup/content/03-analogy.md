### What is Programming?

Think of programming like writing a recipe for a robot chef:

**Cooking with a Human Chef**:
- "Add some salt" (they know what "some" means)
- "Cook until golden brown" (they recognize golden brown)
- "Stir occasionally" (they decide when "occasionally" is)

**Cooking with a Robot Chef** (Programming):
- "Add exactly 5 grams of salt"
- "Cook for 8 minutes at 180°C"
- "Stir every 2 minutes for 10 seconds"

Computers are like robot chefs—they need **exact, unambiguous instructions**. Programming is the art of writing these instructions in a language computers can understand.

### What is a Programming Language?

You speak English (or another human language). Computers speak in binary—millions of 1s and 0s. Programming languages are the bridge:


**Kotlin** is our bridge language. It's designed to be:
- **Readable**: Looks almost like English
- **Precise**: No ambiguity for the computer
- **Safe**: Catches mistakes before they cause problems

You (Human)  →  [Programming Language]  →  Computer (Binary)
"Print Hello"  →  [Kotlin Compiler]  →  10101001001...
