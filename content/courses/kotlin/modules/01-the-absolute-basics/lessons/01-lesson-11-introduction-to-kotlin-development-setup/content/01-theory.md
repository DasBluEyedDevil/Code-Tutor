Welcome to the **Kotlin Multiplatform Development** course! 

In this first lesson, we're going to demystify programming and get you set up with the same tools used by professional developers at companies like Google, Netflix, and Uber. 

By the end of this lesson, you will:
1. Understand how computers "think" and how programming languages bridge the gap between humans and machines.
2. Discover why Kotlin is currently one of the most loved and fastest-growing languages in the world.
3. Successfully set up **Android Studio**, the industry-standard environment for Kotlin development.
4. Write, compile, and run your very first Kotlin program.
5. Create an interactive application that can communicate with users.

Let's get started!
