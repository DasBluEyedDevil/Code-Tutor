### The GPS Analogy

Think of control flow like GPS navigation:

**Conditionals** (if/else): "IF there's traffic ahead, THEN take alternate route, ELSE continue on current road"

**Loops** (for/while): "WHILE you haven't reached destination, keep giving directions"

Your programs use the same logic!
