Welcome to Lesson 1.3! Up to this point, your programs have been like a single-track train—running straight from the first line to the last. But to build truly useful applications, your code needs to be able to make decisions and repeat actions.

In this lesson, you will learn:
1. **Conditionals**: How to use `if`, `else`, and the powerful `when` expression to execute different code based on specific conditions.
2. **Loops**: How to use `for`, `while`, and `do-while` to repeat tasks efficiently without writing the same code over and over.
3. **Control Keywords**: How to use `break` and `continue` to fine-tune your loops.
4. **Ranges**: A clean way to represent sequences of numbers or characters.

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to create interactive games and programs that respond dynamically to user input!
