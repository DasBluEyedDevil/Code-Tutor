**`if` is an expression in Kotlin, not just a statement**. This means it returns a value, allowing you to write `val max = if (a > b) a else b` instead of using a temporary variable. This leads to more concise and functional code.

**Use `when` instead of long if-else chains** when checking a single value against multiple conditions. The `when` expression is more readable and makes your intent clearer than nested if statements.

**Ranges (`1..10`) and the `in` operator** provide elegant iteration and membership testing. Kotlin's range syntax makes loops more expressive than traditional C-style for loops with counters.
