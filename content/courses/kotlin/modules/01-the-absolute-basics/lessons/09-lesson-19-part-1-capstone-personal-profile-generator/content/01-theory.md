**Estimated Time**: 80 minutes

**Difficulty**: Beginner Capstone Project

Welcome to your second capstone project for Part 1: Kotlin Fundamentals! You've learned about variables, data types, control flow, functions, collections, and null safety. Now, it's time to apply all these concepts by building a **Personal Profile Generator**.

In this project, you will:
1. Collect various pieces of personal information from the user (name, age, hobbies, etc.).
2. Perform calculations based on the input (e.g., calculate birth year, display age in different units).
3. Generate a formatted, descriptive profile output.
4. Utilize functions to modularize your code, making it clean and reusable.
5. Implement null safety to handle optional inputs gracefully.

This project will demonstrate your ability to combine foundational Kotlin concepts to create a more complex, interactive application. Let's get started and build something impressive!
