Before moving to Part 2, reflect on your learning:

1. **How did using functions improve your code organization?**
   - Without functions: All code in main(), hard to read
   - With functions: Clear sections, easy to understand and modify

2. **What would you need to change to add a new feature?**
   - Example: Adding "favorite movie" would require:
     - One input line in main()
     - One line in displayProfile()
     - No changes to calculation functions (good design!)

3. **How does this project compare to your first "Hello, World!"?**
   - Lesson 1.1: Simple print statement
   - Lesson 1.9: Complete interactive application!
   - Amazing progress in just a few lessons!
