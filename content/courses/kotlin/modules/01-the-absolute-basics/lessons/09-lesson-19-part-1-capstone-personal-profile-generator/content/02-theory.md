Congratulations! You've reached the capstone project for Part 1 of the Kotlin Training Course. This is where everything comes together!

Over the past lessons, you've learned:
- ✅ How to write and run Kotlin code
- ✅ How to use variables (`val` and `var`)
- ✅ Different data types (Int, Double, String, Boolean)
- ✅ How to get user input with `readln()`
- ✅ How to create and call functions
- ✅ How to pass parameters to functions
- ✅ How to return values from functions
- ✅ String templates for formatted output

Now you'll combine **all of these skills** to build a complete, interactive application: **The Personal Profile Generator**!

### What You'll Build

An interactive command-line application that:
1. Asks users for personal information
2. Performs calculations on that data
3. Displays a beautifully formatted profile
4. Uses well-organized functions
5. Handles multiple pieces of data
6. Creates a professional user experience

This project demonstrates that you can build real, practical applications with what you've learned!
