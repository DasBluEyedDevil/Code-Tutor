**Capstone projects synthesize everything you've learned** into a complete application. This calculator demonstrates variables, functions, control flow, type safety, and user interaction working together.

**Error handling is not optional**—production code must gracefully handle invalid input. Use `try-catch` for operations that can fail, and provide clear error messages to users instead of crashing.

**Code organization matters from day one**. Separate your program into focused functions (`add`, `subtract`, `parseInput`) rather than putting everything in `main()`. This makes testing, debugging, and future enhancements far easier.
