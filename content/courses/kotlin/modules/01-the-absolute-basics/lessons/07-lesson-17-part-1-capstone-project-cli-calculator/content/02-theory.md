Congratulations on making it to the capstone project! You've learned variables, control flow, functions, collections, and null safety. Now it's time to combine all these skills into a real, practical application.

In this project, you'll build a **Command-Line Calculator** that:
- Performs all basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %)
- Has a professional menu system
- Validates user input
- Handles errors gracefully
- Keeps a history of calculations
- Runs until the user chooses to exit

This is a complete, production-style application that demonstrates best practices and real-world programming patterns.
