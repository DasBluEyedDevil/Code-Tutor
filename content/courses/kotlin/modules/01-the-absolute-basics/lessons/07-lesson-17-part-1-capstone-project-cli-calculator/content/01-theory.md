**Estimated Time**: 90 minutes

Congratulations on reaching your first **Capstone Project**! You've learned the absolute basics of Kotlin: variables, data types, control flow, functions, collections, and null safety. Now it's time to put all those skills together.

In this project, you will build a professional-grade **Command Line Calculator**. This isn't just a simple "1+1" program; it will feature:
1. A continuous menu system.
2. Robust error handling for user input.
3. Complex arithmetic operations.
4. History tracking using collections.
5. Modular code using functions.

This project will prove that you can take separate concepts and weave them into a functional, useful application!
