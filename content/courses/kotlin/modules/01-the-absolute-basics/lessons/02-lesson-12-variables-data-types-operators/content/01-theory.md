Welcome to Lesson 1.2! Now that you've got your environment set up and your first "Hello World" running, it's time to dive into the core building blocks of every computer program: **Variables, Data Types, and Operators**.

In this lesson, you will learn:
1. How to store data in named containers (variables).
2. The difference between data that can change and data that stays the same.
3. The various categories of data Kotlin supports, from simple numbers to complex text.
4. How to perform calculations and make comparisons using operators.
5. How Kotlin's smart "Type Inference" makes your code cleaner and faster to write.

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to build programs that handle user data and perform complex math automatically!
