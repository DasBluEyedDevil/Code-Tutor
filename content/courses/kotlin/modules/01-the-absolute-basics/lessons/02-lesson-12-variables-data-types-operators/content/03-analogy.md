### The Box Analogy

Think of variables like labeled boxes in a warehouse:

**Physical Warehouse**:
- **Box**: Container that holds something
- **Label**: Name on the box ("Books", "Toys", "Electronics")
- **Contents**: What's inside the box
- **Type**: What kind of things can go in (books only, toys only, etc.)

**Programming Warehouse**:
- **Variable**: Container that holds data
- **Name**: What you call the variable (`age`, `name`, `price`)
- **Value**: The data stored inside
- **Type**: What kind of data it can hold (numbers, text, true/false)

```kotlin
val age = 25        // Box labeled "age" contains number 25
val name = "Alice"  // Box labeled "name" contains text "Alice"
val isStudent = true  // Box labeled "isStudent" contains true/false
```
