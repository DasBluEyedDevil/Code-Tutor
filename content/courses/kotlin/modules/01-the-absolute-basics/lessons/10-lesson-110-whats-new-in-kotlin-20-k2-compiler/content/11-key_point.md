**The K2 compiler is Kotlin's future**—it brings faster compilation, better error messages, and smarter type inference. All new Kotlin projects should use K2 by default, as it's production-ready and the old compiler is being phased out.

**Most Kotlin 2.x features work seamlessly with existing code**. The language evolution prioritizes backward compatibility, so you can adopt new idioms gradually without rewriting your codebase.

**Stay current with Kotlin releases to benefit from performance and safety improvements**. The language evolves rapidly, but stable APIs remain stable—JetBrains takes backward compatibility seriously for production environments.
