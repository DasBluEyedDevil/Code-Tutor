Kotlin 2.0 was a major milestone released in May 2024 that introduced the K2 compiler as the default. Since then, Kotlin has continued to evolve rapidly through versions 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 (the latest stable release as of early 2026). The K2 compiler is now fully mature, and modern IDEs use K2 mode exclusively.

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- What the K2 compiler is and why it matters
- Key improvements across the Kotlin 2.x releases
- Smarter smart casts and type inference
- What's new in Kotlin 2.2 and 2.3

Understanding these improvements will help you write better Kotlin code and take advantage of the latest features!
