You've been using JSON in your API without really understanding what's happening behind the scenes. When you write `call.receive<Book>()` or `call.respond(book)`, magic happens: Kotlin objects transform into JSON text and back.

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- How JSON serialization actually works
- Advanced `@Serializable` annotations
- Custom serializers for special types (dates, enums, etc.)
- Handling nullable and optional fields
- Polymorphic serialization (base classes and inheritance)
- Error handling for malformed JSON

By the end, you'll have complete control over how your API handles JSON data!
