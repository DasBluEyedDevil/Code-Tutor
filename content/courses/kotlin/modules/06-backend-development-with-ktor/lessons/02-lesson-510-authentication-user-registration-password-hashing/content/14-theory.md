In **Lesson 5.11**, you'll implement the login system using the hashed passwords you just created. You'll learn:
- How to verify passwords against bcrypt hashes
- How to generate JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authenticated sessions
- How to handle login errors securely (without revealing whether email exists)
- Token expiration and refresh strategies

The foundation you built today makes authentication possible!
