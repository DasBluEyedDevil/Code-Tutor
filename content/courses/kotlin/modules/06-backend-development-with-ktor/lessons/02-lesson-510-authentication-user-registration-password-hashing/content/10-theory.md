### Real-World Security

**Password Breach Statistics** (2024 data):
- 81% of data breaches involve stolen/weak passwords
- Average cost of a data breach: $4.45 million
- Companies that store plaintext passwords face massive fines and lawsuits

**Your Responsibility as a Developer**:
When you store user passwords, you're responsible for protecting them. Using bcrypt with proper salting and cost factors is not optional—it's a legal and ethical requirement.

### Industry Standards

**OWASP Top 10 (2023)**:
- #2: Cryptographic Failures (storing passwords insecurely)
- #7: Identification and Authentication Failures

Implementing what you learned today directly addresses two of the top security vulnerabilities.
