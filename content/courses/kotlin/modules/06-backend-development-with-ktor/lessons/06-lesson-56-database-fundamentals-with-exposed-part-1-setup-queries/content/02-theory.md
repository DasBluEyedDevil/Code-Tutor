So far, all your data has been stored in memory. When your server restarts, **everything disappears**. That's not acceptable for real applications!

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- Why databases are essential
- SQL basics for backend developers
- Setting up Exposed (Kotlin's SQL library)
- Creating database tables
- Basic queries: INSERT and SELECT
- Connecting your Ktor API to a real database

By the end, your API will persist data across server restarts!
