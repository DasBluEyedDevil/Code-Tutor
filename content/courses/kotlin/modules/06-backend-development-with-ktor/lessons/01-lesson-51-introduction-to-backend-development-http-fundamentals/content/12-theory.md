Understanding HTTP is like learning the alphabet before writing essays. **Every** backend you ever build—whether with Ktor, Spring Boot, Express.js, Django, or any other framework—uses these exact same concepts:

- **HTTP methods** are universal across all web frameworks
- **Status codes** are standardized (200 always means success, 404 always means not found)
- **RESTful design** makes your API intuitive for other developers

In the next lesson, we'll set up our first Ktor project and turn these concepts into actual working code. But first, you needed to understand *what* you're building and *why* it's designed this way.

When you build your first API endpoint, you'll think: "GET request to `/api/books` returns 200 with a JSON array." You now speak the language of backend development!
