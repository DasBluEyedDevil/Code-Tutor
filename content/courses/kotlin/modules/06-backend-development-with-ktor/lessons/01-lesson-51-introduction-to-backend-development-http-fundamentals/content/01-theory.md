**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Difficulty**: Beginner
**Prerequisites**: Parts 1-4 (Kotlin fundamentals, OOP, functions)

Welcome to Part 5: Backend Development with Ktor! You're about to learn how to build powerful APIs and web services using Kotlin.

**Ktor** is JetBrains' modern, asynchronous framework for building connected applications. It's lightweight, flexible, and fully written in Kotlin with coroutines at its core.

In this module, you'll learn:

1. **HTTP Fundamentals**: How the web works - requests, responses, methods, and status codes
2. **Ktor Basics**: Setting up projects, routing, and handling requests
3. **Data Handling**: JSON serialization, request validation, and error handling
4. **Database Integration**: Using Exposed for database operations
5. **Authentication**: JWT tokens, password hashing, and protected routes
6. **Testing**: Writing tests for your API endpoints

By the end of this module, you'll build a complete **Task Management API** as your capstone project.

Let's start building backends!
