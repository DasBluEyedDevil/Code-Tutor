**Question 1**: **B) GET**
GET is used to retrieve/read data without modifying anything on the server.

**Question 2**: **C) 404 Not Found**
404 means the resource (user 42) doesn't exist at that URL.

**Question 3**: **C) PUT /users/123**
This follows REST principles: plural noun (`users`), resource ID in path (`123`), and proper HTTP method (`PUT` for updates).
