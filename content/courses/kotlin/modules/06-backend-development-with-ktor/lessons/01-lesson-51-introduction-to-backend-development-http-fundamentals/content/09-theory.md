Design a simple API for a **To-Do List Application** on paper. You don't need to write code yet!

**Requirements:**
1. Users can view all their tasks
2. Users can view a single task by ID
3. Users can create a new task
4. Users can mark a task as complete
5. Users can delete a task
6. Users can filter tasks by status (completed/pending)

**Your task:**
- List all the endpoints you would need
- Specify the HTTP method for each
- Include example URLs with query parameters where needed
- Think about what status codes you'd return for each endpoint
