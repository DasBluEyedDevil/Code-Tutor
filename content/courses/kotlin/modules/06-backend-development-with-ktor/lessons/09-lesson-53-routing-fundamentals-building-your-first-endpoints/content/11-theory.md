---


You just built a **production-ready REST API**! This exact pattern is used by:

- **E-commerce sites** for managing products
- **Social media** for managing posts and comments
- **Banking apps** for managing accounts and transactions
- **Any mobile app** that needs to store data on a server

### What You've Mastered

✅ **CRUD Operations**: The foundation of 90% of all APIs
✅ **RESTful Design**: Industry-standard API architecture
✅ **JSON Serialization**: Converting Kotlin ↔ JSON automatically
✅ **Route Organization**: Keeping code clean as it grows
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper status codes for different scenarios
✅ **Request/Response Models**: Type-safe API contracts

### The Missing Piece

Right now, your data disappears when the server restarts (it's only in memory). In the next lessons, you'll learn:

- **Databases**: Persistent storage that survives restarts
- **Validation**: More sophisticated input checking
- **Authentication**: Protecting routes (login required)
- **Testing**: Ensuring your API works correctly

But the routing patterns you learned today? **They stay the same**. You'll just swap the in-memory storage for a database.
