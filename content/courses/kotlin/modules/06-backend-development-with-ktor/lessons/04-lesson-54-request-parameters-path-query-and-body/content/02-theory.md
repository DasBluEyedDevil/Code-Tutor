In the previous lesson, you built a complete CRUD API. But we only scratched the surface of how data can be sent to your server. There are actually **three main ways** clients send data:

1. **Path Parameters**: Data embedded in the URL path (`/users/42`)
2. **Query Parameters**: Key-value pairs after `?` (`/search?q=kotlin&page=2`)
3. **Request Body**: JSON/form data sent with the request

Understanding when and how to use each is crucial for building intuitive, flexible APIs. In this lesson, you'll master all three!
