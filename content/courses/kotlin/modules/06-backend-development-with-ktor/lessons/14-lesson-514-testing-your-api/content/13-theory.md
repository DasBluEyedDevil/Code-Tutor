- Lower maintenance costs

**Companies Without Tests**:
- Manual testing takes hours
- Fear of changing code
- Bugs discovered in production
- Slow feature development
- High stress, long hours

**Statistics**:
- Bugs caught in testing cost 10x less than bugs in production
- Well-tested code has 40-80% fewer production bugs
- Test suites pay for themselves within 6 months
