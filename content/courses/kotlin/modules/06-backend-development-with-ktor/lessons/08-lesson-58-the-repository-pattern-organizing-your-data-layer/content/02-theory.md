Your API is growing. You have routes calling database code directly. What happens when:
- You need to switch from H2 to PostgreSQL?
- You want to add caching?
- You need to write tests without a real database?
- Multiple routes need the same complex query?

The **Repository Pattern** solves these problems by creating a clean separation between your business logic and data access.

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- What the Repository Pattern is and why it matters
- Clean Architecture principles
- Separating concerns: Routes → Services → Repositories
- Making your code testable
- Interface-based design
- Real-world project structure
