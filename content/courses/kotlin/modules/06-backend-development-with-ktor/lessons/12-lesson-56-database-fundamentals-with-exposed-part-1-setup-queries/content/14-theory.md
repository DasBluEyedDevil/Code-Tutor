You just crossed a **massive milestone**: your API now persists data! This is what separates toys from production systems.

### What You've Achieved

✅ **Persistent storage**: Data survives server restarts
✅ **Type-safe SQL**: Compile-time checking (no SQL injection risks)
✅ **Clean architecture**: Separation of database code (DAO) from routes
✅ **Transaction safety**: All-or-nothing guarantees
✅ **Production-ready pattern**: Used by real companies

### Real-World Context

Every app you use stores data in databases:
- **Twitter**: Tweets, users, likes → PostgreSQL
- **Instagram**: Photos, comments → PostgreSQL + Cassandra
- **Netflix**: User preferences → MySQL
- **Uber**: Rides, locations → MySQL + Redis
