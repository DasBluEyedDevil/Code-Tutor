In the next lesson, we'll build on this foundation by implementing **user authentication with password hashing**. You'll learn how to:
- Securely store passwords using bcrypt
- Validate registration data (email format, password strength)
- Handle authentication errors properly
- Prevent common security vulnerabilities

The validation patterns you learned today will be essential for validating user credentials safely!
