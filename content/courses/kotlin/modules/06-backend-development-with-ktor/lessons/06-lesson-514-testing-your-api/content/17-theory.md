In **Lesson 5.15: Part 5 Capstone Project**, you'll build a complete production-ready API from scratch using everything you've learned:
- Full authentication system (registration, login, JWT)
- Role-based access control
- Clean architecture (repositories, services, routes)
- Dependency injection with Koin
- Comprehensive test suite
- Validation and error handling

Time to put all your knowledge together into a real-world application!
