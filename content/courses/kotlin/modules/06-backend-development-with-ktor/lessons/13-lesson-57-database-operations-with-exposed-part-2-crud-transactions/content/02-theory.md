In the previous lesson, you learned to INSERT and SELECT data. Now it's time to complete the CRUD operations: **UPDATE** and **DELETE**.

But that's not all! You'll also learn:
- Complex WHERE clauses with multiple conditions
- Table relationships (foreign keys)
- JOIN queries to combine data from multiple tables
- Batch operations for performance
- Database migrations

By the end, you'll be able to build complex, production-ready database schemas!
