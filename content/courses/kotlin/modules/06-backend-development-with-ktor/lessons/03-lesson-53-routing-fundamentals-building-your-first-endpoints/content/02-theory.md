In the previous lesson, you created a basic server that returns plain text. Now it's time to build something more realistic: a **complete REST API** for managing a collection of books.

In this lesson, you'll:
- Organize routes into logical groups
- Return JSON data instead of plain text
- Implement all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Use proper HTTP methods and status codes
- Store data in memory (temporarily, before we learn databases)

By the end, you'll have a fully functional Books API that behaves like a real-world backend!
