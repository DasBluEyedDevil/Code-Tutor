In **Lesson 5.12**, you'll learn how to **protect routes with JWT authentication**. You'll discover:
- How to configure Ktor's JWT authentication plugin
- How to create authenticated routes that require valid tokens
- How to extract user information from tokens in route handlers
- How to implement role-based access control (admin vs regular users)

The foundation you built today makes all of this possible!
