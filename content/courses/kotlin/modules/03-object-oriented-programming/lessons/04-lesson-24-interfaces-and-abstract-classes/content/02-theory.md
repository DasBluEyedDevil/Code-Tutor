You've learned about inheritance and abstract classes. Now let's explore **interfaces**—one of OOP's most powerful tools for designing flexible, maintainable systems.

An **interface** defines a contract: "Any class that implements me must provide these capabilities." Unlike abstract classes (which you can only inherit from one), a class can implement multiple interfaces, enabling composition of behaviors.

This lesson will teach you:
- How to define and implement interfaces
- The difference between interfaces and abstract classes
- When to use each
- Default interface methods
- Real-world design patterns
