**The Library Management System demonstrates OOP principles in a real application**—classes model domain entities, inheritance represents relationships, and encapsulation protects data integrity.

**Designing class hierarchies requires balancing abstraction and practicality**. Too shallow and you duplicate code; too deep and the system becomes rigid. Favor composition over inheritance when relationships aren't truly "is-a".

**This capstone consolidates your OOP knowledge**: you've gone from single classes to complete systems with multiple interacting objects, inheritance hierarchies, and encapsulated state management.
