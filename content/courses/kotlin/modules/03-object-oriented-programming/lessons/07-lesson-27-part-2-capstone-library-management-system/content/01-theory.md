**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

Welcome to the Part 2 Capstone Project! This is where you'll synthesize everything you've learned about Object-Oriented Programming into a comprehensive, real-world application.

You'll build a **Library Management System** that demonstrates:

**Core OOP Concepts**:
- Classes and objects for modeling books, members, and loans
- Inheritance for different types of library items and member tiers
- Interfaces for common behaviors like borrowable items
- Data classes for immutable records
- Sealed classes for loan status management

**Practical Features**:
- Add, search, and manage books
- Register and track library members
- Handle book loans and returns
- Calculate late fees
- Generate reports and statistics

This capstone project mirrors real-world software development. Take your time, plan your class hierarchies carefully, and don't be afraid to refactor as you go.

Let's build something impressive!
