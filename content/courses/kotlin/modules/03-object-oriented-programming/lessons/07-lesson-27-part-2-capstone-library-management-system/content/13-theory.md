After completing the project, consider:

1. Why did we use an abstract class for `Book` instead of an interface?
2. When would you use a data class vs a regular class?
3. Why is `Library` an object instead of a regular class?
4. How do sealed classes make the status system safer?
5. What are the benefits of using enums for fixed sets of values?
