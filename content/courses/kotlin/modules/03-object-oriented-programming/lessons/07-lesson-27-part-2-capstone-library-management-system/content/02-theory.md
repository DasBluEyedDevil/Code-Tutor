Congratulations on completing all the lessons in Part 2! You've learned the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming in Kotlin:

- ✅ Classes, objects, properties, and methods
- ✅ Constructors and initialization
- ✅ Inheritance and polymorphism
- ✅ Interfaces and abstract classes
- ✅ Data classes and sealed classes
- ✅ Object declarations and companion objects

Now it's time to put it all together in a **comprehensive capstone project**: a **Library Management System**.

This project will challenge you to apply all OOP concepts in a real-world scenario where you manage books, members, loans, and library operations.
