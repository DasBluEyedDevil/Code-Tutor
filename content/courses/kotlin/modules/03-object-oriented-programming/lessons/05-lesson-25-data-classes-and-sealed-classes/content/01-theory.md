**Estimated Time**: 65 minutes

In this lesson, you'll learn about two of Kotlin's most powerful class features that set it apart from other languages.

**Data Classes** eliminate the boilerplate code you'd normally write for classes that just hold data. With a single line, Kotlin generates `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`, `copy()`, and component functions automatically.

**Sealed Classes** give you exhaustive control over class hierarchies. They're perfect for representing states, results, or any scenario where you know all possible subtypes at compile time.

By the end of this lesson, you'll:
1. Create data classes with automatic functionality
2. Use the `copy()` function for immutable updates
3. Understand destructuring declarations
4. Build sealed class hierarchies for type-safe state management
5. Use sealed classes with `when` expressions for exhaustive handling

These features are used extensively in modern Kotlin applications, especially in Android development with Compose.
