**Question 1: B) Automatically generates `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`, and `copy()`**

Data classes save you from writing boilerplate code.


---

**Question 2: B) Extracting multiple properties into separate variables at once**

Destructuring uses the `componentN()` functions generated by data classes.


---

**Question 3: B) They provide exhaustive `when` expression checking**

The compiler ensures you handle all subclasses of a sealed class.


---

**Question 4: B) When you primarily need to hold data**

Data classes are perfect for DTOs, API models, configuration, etc.


---

**Question 5: B) Sealed classes can have subclasses with different properties; enums cannot**

Enums are for fixed constants with the same structure. Sealed classes are for type hierarchies with varying data.

```kotlin
// Enum: All instances have same structure
enum class Color(val hex: String) {
    RED("#FF0000"),
    GREEN("#00FF00")
}

// Sealed: Subclasses have different properties
sealed class Result {
    data class Success(val data: String) : Result()
    data class Error(val code: Int, val message: String) : Result()
}
```
