Kotlin provides special class types that solve common programming patterns elegantly. You've learned about regular classes, abstract classes, and interfaces. Now let's explore two powerful Kotlin features:

**Data Classes**: Classes designed to hold data with automatic implementations of `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`, and `copy()`.

**Sealed Classes**: Classes with a restricted hierarchy where all subclasses are known at compile-time, perfect for representing state or result types.

These features make Kotlin code more concise, safer, and more expressive than traditional OOP languages.
