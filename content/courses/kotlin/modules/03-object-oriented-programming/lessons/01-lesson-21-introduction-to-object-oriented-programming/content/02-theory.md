Welcome to Part 2 of the Kotlin Training Course! You've mastered the fundamentals—variables, control flow, functions, and collections. Now it's time to learn **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, a paradigm that will transform how you design and structure your code.

OOP is more than just a programming technique—it's a way of thinking about problems. Instead of writing procedural code that executes step-by-step, you'll learn to model real-world entities as **objects** with their own data and behavior.

By the end of this lesson, you'll understand what OOP is, why it matters, and how to create your first classes and objects in Kotlin.
