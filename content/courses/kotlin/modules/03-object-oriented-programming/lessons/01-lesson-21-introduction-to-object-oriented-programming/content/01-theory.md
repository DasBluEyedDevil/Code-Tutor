Welcome to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Kotlin! This lesson marks the beginning of Part 2, where you'll learn to think about programming in a fundamentally new way.

In this lesson, you will:
1. Understand what Object-Oriented Programming is and why it matters
2. Learn the four pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
3. Create your first classes and objects in Kotlin
4. Understand the relationship between classes (blueprints) and objects (instances)
5. Write methods and properties to give your objects behavior and state

Let's begin your journey into the world of objects!
