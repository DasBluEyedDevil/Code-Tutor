You've learned to create classes and manage properties. Now it's time to explore one of OOP's most powerful features: **inheritance**.

Inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing ones, reusing and extending their functionality. Combined with **polymorphism**, you can write flexible, maintainable code that models complex real-world relationships.

Imagine you're building a system for different types of employees: managers, developers, and interns. They all share common attributes (name, ID, salary) but have unique behaviors. Inheritance lets you capture these commonalities and differences elegantly.
