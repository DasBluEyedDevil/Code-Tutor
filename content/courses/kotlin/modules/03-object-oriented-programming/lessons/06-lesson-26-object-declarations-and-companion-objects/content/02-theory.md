So far, you've created classes and instantiated them into objects. But what if you need:
- Only **one instance** of a class (singleton pattern)?
- **Static-like members** (methods/properties that belong to the class, not instances)?
- **Anonymous objects** for one-time use?

Kotlin provides elegant solutions through:
- **Object expressions** - Anonymous objects
- **Object declarations** - Singletons
- **Companion objects** - Static-like members within classes

These features eliminate boilerplate code and provide type-safe alternatives to Java's static members.
