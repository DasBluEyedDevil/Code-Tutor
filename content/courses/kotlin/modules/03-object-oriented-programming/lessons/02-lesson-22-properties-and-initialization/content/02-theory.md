In Lesson 2.1, you learned the basics of classes and objects. Now it's time to dive deeper into **properties**—the data that objects hold.

Kotlin provides powerful features for managing properties that go far beyond simple variables:
- **Custom getters and setters** for computed or validated values
- **Late initialization** for properties that can't be set immediately
- **Lazy initialization** for expensive operations that should only happen when needed
- **Backing fields** for advanced property control
- **Property delegation** to reuse property logic

These features make Kotlin properties more flexible and powerful than in most other languages. Let's explore them!
