**Goal**: Create a `UserProfile` class that lazily loads expensive data.

**Requirements**:
1. Properties: `username`, `email`
2. Lazy property: `profilePicture` (simulated expensive load)
3. Lazy property: `activityHistory` (simulated database query)
4. Method: `displayProfile()` - shows all info (triggers lazy loading)
