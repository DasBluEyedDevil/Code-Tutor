**Update Kotlin to 2.0+ to use K2**—it's enabled by default. For gradual migration, use `kotlin.experimental.tryK2=true` in Gradle properties to test K2 while keeping old compiler as fallback.

**Fix compile errors incrementally**—K2's stricter type checking catches errors the old compiler missed. These are usually latent bugs (unsafe casts, incorrect nullability) that K2 surfaces.

**Test thoroughly after migration**—while K2 is designed for compatibility, generated bytecode may differ slightly. Run your full test suite and monitor production for unexpected behavior changes.
