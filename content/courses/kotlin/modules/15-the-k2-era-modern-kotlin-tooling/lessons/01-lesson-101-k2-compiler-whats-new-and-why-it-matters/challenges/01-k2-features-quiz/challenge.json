  "title": "K2 Features Quiz",
  "description": "Test your understanding of the K2 compiler, its improvements, and what it means for Kotlin developers.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "text": "What is the primary benefit of the K2 compiler over the K1 (old) compiler?",
      "options": [
        "K2 adds new language features that K1 cannot support",
        "K2 is significantly faster (up to 2x compilation speed) with better type inference and IDE responsiveness",
        "K2 only works with Kotlin Multiplatform projects",
        "K2 replaces the need for Gradle"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The K2 compiler rewrites the frontend with a new architecture that is up to 2x faster for compilation. It also improves type inference (smarter smart casts, better lambda inference) and makes the IDE experience faster with a new FIR-based analysis engine."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "text": "What does 'FIR' stand for in the context of the K2 compiler?",
      "options": [
        "Fast Incremental Recompilation",
        "Frontend Intermediate Representation",
        "Full Integration Runtime",
        "Functional Inference Resolution"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "FIR (Frontend Intermediate Representation) is the new data structure K2 uses to represent Kotlin code during compilation. It replaces the old PSI-based analysis with a more efficient tree structure that enables faster type checking and resolution."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "text": "In Kotlin 2.0+, what is the recommended way to enable the K2 compiler?",
      "options": [
        "Add a compiler plugin to build.gradle.kts",
        "K2 is the DEFAULT compiler since Kotlin 2.0 -- no action needed",
        "Set languageVersion = '2.0' in kotlin.compilerOptions",
        "Install a separate K2 SDK"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Since Kotlin 2.0, the K2 compiler is the default. You do not need to enable it explicitly. The old K1 compiler can still be forced with -language-version 1.9 if needed for migration, but K2 is the standard path forward."
