title: "K2 as a New Engine in an Existing Car"
---

The K2 compiler is like replacing your car's engine with a modern, more efficient one—same car, better performance.

**The old compiler is a reliable but aging engine**—it's gotten you everywhere you needed to go for years, but it's slow, burns more fuel than necessary, and can't support new features modern cars need (advanced sensors, hybrid technology).

**K2 is a completely redesigned engine** built from scratch with modern engineering—faster acceleration (2x compilation speed), better fuel economy (smarter optimizations), and built to support future technologies (upcoming Kotlin features).

**The car itself (Kotlin language) looks the same**—you still write the same Kotlin code, use the same syntax, and your programs behave identically. Drivers (developers) don't need to learn new controls; the upgrade is mostly invisible.

**Some adjustments might be needed** during the swap—just like a new engine might require updating mounts or sensors, K2's stricter type checking might surface bugs the old compiler missed. These are usually latent issues that were always there.

**The old engine is being retired**—it won't receive new features or improvements. Eventually, it'll stop being supported entirely. Getting the new engine now ensures you're ready for future road trips (Kotlin language features).

Like upgrading a car engine, you get immediate performance benefits (faster builds), long-term support (future features), and smoother operation (better error messages), all while driving the same familiar car (Kotlin language).
