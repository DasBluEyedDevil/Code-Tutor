**The K2 compiler is a complete rewrite** bringing 2x faster compilation, smarter type inference, and better error messages. It's the foundation for all future Kotlin language features.

**K2 is production-ready and the default** in Kotlin 2.0+. The old compiler is deprecated and will be removed—all new projects should use K2 from day one.

**Migration is mostly transparent**—K2 is designed for backward compatibility. Most codebases compile unchanged; issues are typically edge cases in generic type inference or overload resolution.
