KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing) is the standard replacement for kapt (deprecated in Kotlin 2.0). KSP is significantly faster and designed specifically for Kotlin. If you're still using kapt for annotation processing, migrating to KSP will cut your build times substantially and future-proof your project.

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- Why KSP is faster than kapt
- How to migrate common libraries from kapt to KSP
- KSP configuration and optimization
- Troubleshooting KSP issues
