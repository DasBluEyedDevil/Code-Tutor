  "description": "Test your understanding of the TaskFlow capstone architecture, technology choices, and KMP project structure.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "text": "In the TaskFlow capstone, which module contains the @Serializable data classes shared between the server and client?",
      "options": [
        "server/ -- the server generates the classes and the client copies them",
        "composeApp/ -- the UI module owns the data models",
        "shared/ -- commonMain source set compiles to all targets",
        "Each module defines its own copy of the models"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The shared/ module's commonMain source set contains @Serializable data classes (Task, User, DTOs) that compile to JVM (server), Android, and Desktop targets. This guarantees the server and client use identical types with no mapping code."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "text": "Why does TaskFlow use H2 instead of PostgreSQL for the server database?",
      "options": [
        "H2 is faster than PostgreSQL for all workloads",
        "H2 is an embedded JVM database requiring zero setup -- no Docker or external services needed",
        "PostgreSQL does not work with Exposed ORM",
        "H2 supports multiplatform compilation to Android and iOS"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "H2 runs as an embedded JVM database. It creates tables in memory (or a local file) automatically when the Ktor server starts. This eliminates the need to install PostgreSQL, run Docker, or configure cloud databases -- making the capstone accessible to all students."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "text": "What is the purpose of the 'synced' column in the SQLDelight TaskEntity table?",
      "options": [
        "It stores the server-side primary key for the task",
        "It tracks whether a local change has been pushed to the server, enabling offline-first behavior",
        "It indicates whether the task is visible in the UI",
        "It records the timestamp of the last synchronization"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The synced column (INTEGER, 0 or 1) tracks whether local changes have been pushed to the server. When the user creates or updates a task offline, synced is set to 0. The SyncManager queries selectUnsynced to find these records and pushes them when connectivity returns."
