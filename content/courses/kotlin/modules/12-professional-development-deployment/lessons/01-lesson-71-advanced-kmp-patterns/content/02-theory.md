Welcome to Part 7 of the Kotlin Training Course! You've been building KMP apps throughout this course, so you already understand the fundamentals: shared code, expect/actual declarations, and the basic project structure.

Now it's time to go deeper. This lesson covers **advanced KMP patterns** that professional developers use to build production-ready cross-platform applications:

- Swift interoperability for iOS integration
- CocoaPods integration for iOS dependencies
- C interop (cinterop) for native libraries
- Publishing KMP libraries for others to use
- Advanced expect/actual patterns

These techniques will help you build professional KMP libraries and integrate seamlessly with existing iOS/native ecosystems.
