title: "Deployment as a Product Launch"

Deploying an application is like launching a physical product in stores worldwide.

**Development is manufacturing**—building the product in your factory (local machine, CI/CD). You test prototypes, fix defects, and ensure quality before shipping.

**Code signing is like anti-counterfeiting seals**—certificates prove your app is genuinely from you, not a fake/tampered version. Without signing, stores (App Store, Play Store) won't accept your product, and customers can't trust it.

**CI/CD pipelines are automated packaging lines**—every time you complete a new batch (commit code), machines test it, package it, and prepare it for shipping without manual labor. This scales from one product to thousands.

**Beta testing (TestFlight, Play Beta) is soft launch in select markets**—release to a small group first, gather feedback, catch issues before the worldwide launch. If there's a critical defect, you fix it before millions of customers see it.

**Production deployment is stocking shelves globally**—your app appears in App Store/Play Store "shelves" where customers (users) can download it. Once on shelves, you need monitoring (sales reports/crash analytics) to know if customers are happy or encountering problems.

Like physical products, you can't recall apps easily once launched—rigorous pre-launch testing prevents expensive post-launch fixes.
