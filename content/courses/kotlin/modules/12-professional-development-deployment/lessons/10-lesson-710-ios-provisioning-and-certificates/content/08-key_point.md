**iOS provisioning profiles bind app, device, and certificate together**, controlling where your app can run. Development profiles for testing, distribution profiles for App Store and TestFlight.

**Certificates prove you're authorized to sign iOS apps**. Development certificates for local testing, distribution certificates for App Store submission. Manage them via Apple Developer portal or Xcode.

**Provisioning is more complex than Android signing**—profiles expire, devices must be registered, certificates must match bundle IDs. Tools like Fastlane Match automate certificate management for teams.
