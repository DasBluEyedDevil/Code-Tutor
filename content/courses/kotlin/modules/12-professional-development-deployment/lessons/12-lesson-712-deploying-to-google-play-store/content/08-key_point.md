**Play Store deployment requires signed AAB/APK, privacy policy, content rating, and store listing**. The first release is manual through Play Console; subsequent releases can be automated.

**Use staged rollouts** to deploy to small percentages of users first (1%, 10%, 50%). Monitor crash rates and reviews before rolling out to 100%—this catches issues before they affect everyone.

**Track vitals in Play Console**: crash rate, ANR rate, battery drain, startup time. Google uses these metrics for app ranking; poor vitals reduce visibility in search and recommendations.
