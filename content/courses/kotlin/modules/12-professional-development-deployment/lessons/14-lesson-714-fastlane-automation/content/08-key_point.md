**Fastlane automates iOS and Android deployment tasks**—building, signing, screenshotting, uploading to stores. Define lanes in `Fastfile` that chain actions together into deployment workflows.

**Use Fastlane Match for team certificate management**—store certificates and profiles in encrypted Git repo, sync across team members and CI. This eliminates manual provisioning profile pain.

**Fastlane integrates with CI** via GitHub Actions or other platforms. Run `fastlane beta` to build and upload to TestFlight, `fastlane release` to submit to App Store—all automated from git tags.
