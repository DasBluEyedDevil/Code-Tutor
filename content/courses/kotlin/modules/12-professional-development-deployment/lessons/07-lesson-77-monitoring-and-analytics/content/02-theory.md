Deploying your app is just the beginning. The real question is: **How is it performing in production?**

Without monitoring, you're flying blind:
- ❌ Users experience crashes, you don't know
- ❌ APIs are slow, no alerts
- ❌ Features are unused, wasted effort
- ❌ Servers are down, customers leave

In this lesson, you'll master production monitoring:
- ✅ Application logging strategies
- ✅ Error tracking (Sentry, Firebase Crashlytics)
- ✅ Analytics (Firebase Analytics, Mixpanel)
- ✅ Performance monitoring (APM)
- ✅ Alerting and incident response
- ✅ User feedback integration
