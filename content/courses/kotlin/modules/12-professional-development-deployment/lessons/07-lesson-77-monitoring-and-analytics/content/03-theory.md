### The Cost of Ignorance

**Real Examples**:

**Case 1: Silent Failures**
- E-commerce site payment API failing
- 20% of checkout attempts fail
- Company loses $50K before noticing
- Customers blame themselves, leave negative reviews

**Case 2: Performance Degradation**
- App becomes 5x slower over 2 weeks
- Users complain on social media
- No internal alerts
- 30% user churn before fix

**Case 3: Feature Waste**
- Team builds complex search feature
- 6 weeks of development
- Analytics show 0.1% adoption
- Could have built something users wanted

### The Power of Data

**With Proper Monitoring**:
- Detect issues in seconds, not days
- Fix bugs before users complain
- Build features users actually use
- Make data-driven decisions
