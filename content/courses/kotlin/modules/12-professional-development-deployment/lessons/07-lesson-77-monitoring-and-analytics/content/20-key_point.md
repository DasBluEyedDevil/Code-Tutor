**Monitor production apps with crash reporting and analytics**—Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry, or AppCenter catch crashes and provide stack traces for debugging production issues.

**Track key metrics: crash-free rate, API latency percentiles, user engagement**. Set up alerts for regressions—if crash rate spikes or API P99 latency doubles, you need to know immediately.

**Log strategically, not exhaustively**—log errors, security events, and business-critical operations. Avoid logging personal data or creating logs so verbose they're unsearchable.
