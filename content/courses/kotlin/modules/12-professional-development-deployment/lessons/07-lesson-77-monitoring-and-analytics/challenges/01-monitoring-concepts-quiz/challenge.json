  "description": "Test your understanding of application monitoring, logging, and analytics for deployed KMP applications.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "text": "What is the difference between structured logging and unstructured logging?",
      "options": [
        "Structured logging uses XML, unstructured uses JSON",
        "Structured logging emits machine-parseable key-value fields; unstructured outputs free-text strings",
        "Structured logging is for production, unstructured is for development only",
        "There is no difference -- they are the same"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Structured logging outputs log entries as key-value pairs (often JSON) that can be indexed and queried by monitoring tools. Unstructured logging produces human-readable text strings that are harder to search and aggregate programmatically."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "text": "In a KMP backend (Ktor), what should a health check endpoint return?",
      "options": [
        "The full application configuration including secrets",
        "A simple HTTP 200 with basic status info (database connectivity, uptime)",
        "The complete server log file",
        "A redirect to the monitoring dashboard"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A health check endpoint returns HTTP 200 with minimal status information (up/down, database reachable, uptime). It should NEVER expose secrets, full configs, or sensitive internal state. Load balancers and orchestrators poll this endpoint to determine instance health."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "text": "Which metric is MOST important for detecting a memory leak in a Ktor backend?",
      "options": [
        "HTTP request count per minute",
        "JVM heap usage trending upward over time without returning to baseline",
        "CPU usage spikes during peak hours",
        "Network bandwidth utilization"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A memory leak shows as JVM heap usage that grows over time and never returns to a stable baseline after garbage collection. Request count and CPU spikes are normal under load. Network bandwidth relates to traffic volume, not memory."
