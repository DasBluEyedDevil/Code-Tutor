**Deploy backend APIs to cloud platforms** like AWS, Google Cloud, or Fly.io for scalability and reliability. Containerize with Docker for consistent environments across development and production.

**Use managed databases instead of self-hosting** when possible—services like Amazon RDS, Cloud SQL, or PlanetScale handle backups, scaling, and maintenance. Your time is better spent on features than database administration.

**Implement health checks and graceful shutdown** in your APIs. Health endpoints enable load balancers to route traffic away from unhealthy instances; graceful shutdown completes in-flight requests before terminating.
