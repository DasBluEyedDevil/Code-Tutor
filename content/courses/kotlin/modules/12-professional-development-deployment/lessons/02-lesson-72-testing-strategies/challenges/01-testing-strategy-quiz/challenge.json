  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "text": "In the testing pyramid, which layer should have the MOST tests in a KMP project?",
      "options": [
        "UI tests (Compose Multiplatform)",
        "Integration tests (API + database)",
        "Unit tests (shared business logic)",
        "End-to-end tests (full app flows)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Unit tests form the base of the testing pyramid. In KMP, shared business logic in commonMain should have the most tests because they run on all platforms without platform-specific setup."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "text": "What is the primary advantage of testing shared KMP code in commonTest?",
      "options": [
        "Tests run faster than platform-specific tests",
        "Tests automatically verify behavior on ALL target platforms",
        "Tests can access platform-specific APIs",
        "Tests don't need any test framework"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Tests in commonTest run on every configured target (JVM, iOS, JS, etc.), ensuring shared logic works identically across platforms. This is the core value proposition of KMP testing."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "text": "When should you use platform-specific test source sets (e.g., androidUnitTest, iosTest)?",
      "options": [
        "For all tests to ensure platform correctness",
        "Only when testing expect/actual implementations or platform-specific behavior",
        "Never -- commonTest covers everything",
        "Only for UI tests"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Platform-specific test source sets are needed when testing expect/actual declarations, platform-specific drivers (SQLDelight drivers, Ktor engines), or behavior that differs by platform."
