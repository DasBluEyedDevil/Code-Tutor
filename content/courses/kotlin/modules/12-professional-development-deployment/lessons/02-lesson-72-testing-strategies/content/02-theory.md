Testing is not optional in professional software development - it's a critical skill that separates hobbyist code from production-ready applications.

In this lesson, you'll master advanced testing strategies for Kotlin applications:
- ✅ Unit testing with JUnit 5 and Kotest
- ✅ Mocking dependencies with MockK
- ✅ Testing coroutines and flows
- ✅ Testing Jetpack Compose UI
- ✅ Test-driven development (TDD)
- ✅ Measuring code coverage

By the end, you'll write tests that give you confidence to refactor, deploy, and sleep peacefully at night.
