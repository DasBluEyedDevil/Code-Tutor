### Real-World Breaches

**Equifax (2017)**:
- Vulnerability: Unpatched Apache Struts
- Impact: 147 million records exposed
- Cost: $1.4 billion in damages
- Cause: Security neglect

**Facebook (2019)**:
- Vulnerability: Passwords stored in plaintext
- Impact: 600 million passwords exposed
- Cause: Not hashing passwords

**Uber (2016)**:
- Vulnerability: AWS keys in GitHub repository
- Impact: 57 million users compromised
- Cost: $148 million fine
- Cause: Hardcoded secrets

**The Pattern**: These weren't sophisticated attacks. They were basic security mistakes that could have been prevented.
