Security isn't optional - it's your responsibility as a developer.

A single security vulnerability can:
- Expose millions of user credentials
- Cost companies millions in damages
- Destroy user trust forever
- End careers

In this lesson, you'll master security best practices for Kotlin applications:
- ✅ Secure coding principles
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Encryption and hashing
- ✅ API security (OAuth 2.0, JWT)
- ✅ Android security (KeyStore, ProGuard/R8)
- ✅ OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

By the end, you'll build applications that protect user data and withstand attacks.
