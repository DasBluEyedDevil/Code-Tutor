Welcome to the world of **Compose Multiplatform** - the modern toolkit for building native UIs across Android, iOS, Desktop, and Web!

Compose uses a **declarative** approach: you describe what the UI should look like, and Compose handles the rest. This is a fundamental shift from imperative UI programming. With Compose Multiplatform, the same UI code runs on both Android and iOS.

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- What Compose Multiplatform is and why it's revolutionary
- How to write composable functions
- Using Preview annotations for instant feedback
- Basic UI components (Text, Button, Image, Column, Row)
- Modifiers for styling and layout
- Basic state management with `remember`
- Running your app on both Android and iOS
