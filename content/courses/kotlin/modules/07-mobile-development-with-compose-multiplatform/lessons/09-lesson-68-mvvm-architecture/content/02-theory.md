Architecture patterns separate concerns, make code testable, and enable team collaboration. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is the recommended architecture for both Android and iOS apps with Compose Multiplatform.

The same MVVM patterns work on both platforms - your ViewModels, state management, and architecture remain consistent!

In this lesson, you'll master:
- ✅ MVVM pattern explained
- ✅ ViewModel lifecycle and scope
- ✅ LiveData vs StateFlow comparison
- ✅ Dependency injection with Hilt/Koin (cross-platform)
- ✅ Clean architecture layers
- ✅ Testing ViewModels
- ✅ Best practices for multiplatform architecture
