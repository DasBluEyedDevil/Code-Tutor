Apps need to store data locally for offline access, caching, and user preferences. For Compose Multiplatform, we use cross-platform solutions that work on both Android and iOS.

**Cross-Platform Options:**
- **SQLDelight**: Cross-platform database (recommended for multiplatform)
- **Room**: Android-only (great for Android-specific projects)
- **Multiplatform Settings**: Cross-platform key-value storage

In this lesson, you'll master:
- ✅ Room/SQLDelight database setup and configuration
- ✅ Entity definitions with relationships
- ✅ DAOs (Data Access Objects) for queries
- ✅ Repository pattern with databases
- ✅ Flows for reactive data updates
- ✅ DataStore/Settings for preferences
- ✅ **iOS storage APIs (UserDefaults equivalent)**
- ✅ Combining local and remote data
