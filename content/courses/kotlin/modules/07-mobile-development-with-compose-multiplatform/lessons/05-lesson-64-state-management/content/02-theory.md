State is the **heart** of any interactive app. When a user clicks a button, types text, or scrolls a list - all of these change state, and the UI must respond.

In Compose Multiplatform, state management is **declarative** and **automatic**. When state changes, Compose intelligently recomposes only the affected parts of the UI. The same state management patterns work on both Android and iOS!

In this lesson, you'll master:
- ✅ Understanding state and recomposition
- ✅ `remember` vs `rememberSaveable`
- ✅ State hoisting pattern
- ✅ ViewModel integration (works on both platforms)
- ✅ Different state holders and patterns
- ✅ Best practices for managing state
