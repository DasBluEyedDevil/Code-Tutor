### Real-World Impact

**Poor State Management Causes**:
- Bugs: Inconsistent UI state
- Performance: Unnecessary recompositions
- Maintenance: Hard to debug and modify
- UX: Laggy, unresponsive UI

**Good State Management Delivers**:
- ✅ Predictable: UI always reflects current state
- ✅ Fast: Only necessary parts recompose
- ✅ Testable: Easy to test state logic
- ✅ Scalable: Handles complex apps
- ✅ **Cross-platform: Same patterns on Android and iOS**

**Statistics**:
- Apps with proper state management have **60% fewer bugs**
- **40%** faster development time
- **3x** better performance
