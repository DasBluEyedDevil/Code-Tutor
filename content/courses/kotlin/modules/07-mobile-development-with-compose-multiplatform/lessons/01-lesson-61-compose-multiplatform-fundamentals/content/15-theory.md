Test your app on different screen sizes:

### Requirements

1. Create an Android **Pixel Tablet** emulator (API 34)
2. Run your app on the tablet - observe how it looks on a larger screen
3. If on macOS, also run on **iPhone 15** and **iPad** simulators
4. Notice how the same code adapts to different screen sizes

### Bonus Challenge

Modify your `App.kt` to display "Running on Android" or "Running on iOS" using the expect/actual pattern.
