Welcome to Compose Multiplatform! This is where Kotlin truly shines - building beautiful, native UIs for Android, iOS, Desktop, and Web from a single codebase.

**Compose Multiplatform** is JetBrains' declarative UI framework that extends Jetpack Compose beyond Android. If you know Jetpack Compose, you already know most of what you need!

In this lesson, you'll learn:

1. **Declarative UI**: Describing *what* your UI should look like, not *how* to create it
2. **Composable Functions**: The building blocks of Compose UIs with `@Composable`
3. **State Management**: Making your UI react to data changes
4. **Layouts**: Row, Column, Box, and other layout composables
5. **Modifiers**: Styling and positioning your UI elements

By the end of this module, you'll be building cross-platform applications with shared UI code that looks and feels native on every platform.

Let's compose something beautiful!
