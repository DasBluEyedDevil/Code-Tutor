**Compose Multiplatform enables UI code sharing across Android, iOS, desktop, and web** using a single declarative UI framework. Write your UI once in Kotlin and deploy everywhere with native performance.

**Composables are functions annotated with `@Composable`** that describe UI declaratively. They're recomposed (re-executed) when their data changes, automatically updating the UI without manual DOM manipulation.

**CMP shares Compose's core principles from Android**: unidirectional data flow, state hoisting, and composition over inheritance. Skills learned here transfer directly to Android Jetpack Compose development.
