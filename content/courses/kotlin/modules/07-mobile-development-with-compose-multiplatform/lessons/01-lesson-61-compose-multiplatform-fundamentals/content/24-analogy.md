title: "UI as Recipe Ingredients"

Think of Compose Multiplatform like a universal recipe system for cooking.

**Traditional UI frameworks** are like having different recipes for each kitchen—one for an American oven (Android), one for a French stove (iOS), one for a Chinese wok (web). You need to learn completely different cooking methods for each kitchen.

**Compose Multiplatform** is like having one master recipe that works in any kitchen. You list the ingredients (UI components) and steps (composable functions), and the framework translates it to work with whatever cooking equipment is available. Whether you're using an Android phone, iPhone, or desktop browser, the same "recipe" produces the same delicious app.

The ingredients are the same (`Text`, `Button`, `Column`), but the framework adapts to each platform's "kitchen"—using native rendering engines while keeping your code identical.
