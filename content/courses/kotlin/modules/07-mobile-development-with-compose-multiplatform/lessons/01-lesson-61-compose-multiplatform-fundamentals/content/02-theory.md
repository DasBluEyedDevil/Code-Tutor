Welcome to **Part 6: Cross-Platform Development with Compose Multiplatform**!

You've mastered Kotlin fundamentals, object-oriented programming, functional programming, and backend development with Ktor. Now it's time to bring your skills to cross-platform UI development.

**Compose Multiplatform** is JetBrains' framework for building native user interfaces that run on Android, iOS, Desktop, and Web from a single Kotlin codebase. iOS support is **stable** and the framework continues to evolve rapidly (latest version 1.10.0 as of January 2026), making Compose Multiplatform a production-ready choice for cross-platform development.

In this lesson, you'll:
- ✅ Understand what Compose Multiplatform is and its platform support
- ✅ Install and configure your development environment
- ✅ Create your first Compose Multiplatform project
- ✅ Understand the multiplatform project structure
- ✅ Learn about shared code and platform-specific code
- ✅ Run apps on Android emulator and iOS simulator
