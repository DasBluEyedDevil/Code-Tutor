**Compose animations are declarative—specify the target state and let the framework interpolate**. Use `animateDpAsState`, `animateColorAsState`, and similar functions to animate individual properties.

**`AnimatedVisibility` adds enter/exit animations** to composables appearing/disappearing. Combine with `fadeIn()`, `slideIn()`, `expandIn()` to create smooth transitions.

**Animations improve user experience when used purposefully**—they provide feedback, guide attention, and indicate relationships. But don't overuse them; gratuitous animations slow down interfaces and distract users.
