In **Lesson 6.10: Part 6 Capstone - Task Manager App**, you'll build:
- Complete multiplatform app from scratch
- All concepts integrated (MVVM, Database, Navigation, Animations)
- Task CRUD operations
- Categories, priorities, due dates
- Material Design 3 UI
- **Runs on both Android and iOS!**

Time to put everything together and build for both platforms!
