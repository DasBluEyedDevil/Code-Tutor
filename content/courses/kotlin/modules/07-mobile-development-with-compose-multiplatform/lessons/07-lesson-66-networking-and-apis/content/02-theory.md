Modern apps rely on network data from REST APIs, whether it's social media posts, weather data, or e-commerce products. Apps must fetch, parse, and display this data efficiently on both Android and iOS.

With Compose Multiplatform, we use **Ktor** for cross-platform networking (though Retrofit works for Android-only projects). The same networking code works on both platforms!

In this lesson, you'll master:
- ✅ Ktor/Retrofit setup for REST APIs
- ✅ Kotlin Serialization for JSON parsing
- ✅ Coroutines for async network calls
- ✅ Error handling and retry logic
- ✅ Loading states and UI feedback
- ✅ Image loading with Coil/Kamel
- ✅ Cross-platform networking considerations
