- `Either<E, A>` provides typed error handling with explicit error types
- Use `either { }` builder with `bind()` for clean chaining
- `Validated<E, A>` accumulates all errors (use for form validation)
- `Option<A>` makes optionality explicit
- Combine types: Validated for input, Either for processing
- Arrow Core 1.2.4 is production-ready and widely used
