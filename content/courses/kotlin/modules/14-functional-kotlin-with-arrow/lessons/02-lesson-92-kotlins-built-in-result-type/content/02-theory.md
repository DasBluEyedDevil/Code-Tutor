Exceptions have problems: they're invisible in type signatures, easy to forget, and create hidden control flow. Kotlin's `Result<T>` type provides a functional alternative for error handling.

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- How to use `Result<T>` for explicit error handling
- Chaining operations with `map`, `mapCatching`, and `fold`
- Converting between Result and exceptions
- When to use Result vs exceptions
