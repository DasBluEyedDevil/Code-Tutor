- Railway-oriented programming visualizes error handling as two tracks
- `flatMap` and `either { }` with `bind()` chain operations
- Errors short-circuit the pipeline (stay on failure track)
- Handle errors at the end of the railway with `fold`
- Use specific error types for clear error handling
- Independent operations can run in parallel with `parZip`
