Congratulations on completing Module 09: Functional Kotlin with Arrow!

You've learned:

**Functional Programming Principles**
- Pure functions and immutability
- Function composition and higher-order functions
- Referential transparency

**Error Handling Types**
- `Result<T>` for basic error handling
- `Either<E, A>` for typed errors
- `Validated<E, A>` for error accumulation
- `Option<A>` for explicit optionality

**Railway-Oriented Programming**
- The two-track metaphor
- Chaining with flatMap and either { }
- Handling errors at boundaries

**Effect System**
- `Raise<E>` for clean error handling
- `ensure` and `ensureNotNull`
- Composing effects with coroutines

**Practical Patterns**
- Error hierarchies
- Safe API calls
- ViewModel integration
- Ktor routes
- Testing strategies

These skills enable you to write safer, more maintainable Kotlin code that handles errors gracefully and explicitly.
