### Core Principles

Functional programming is built on several key ideas:

**1. Pure Functions**
- Same inputs always produce same outputs
- No side effects (no I/O, no mutations, no global state)
- Predictable and testable

**2. Immutability**
- Data never changes after creation
- "Changes" create new data
- Eliminates entire classes of bugs

**3. Function Composition**
- Build complex behavior from simple functions
- Functions as first-class values
- Declarative over imperative

**4. Referential Transparency**
- An expression can be replaced with its value
- Makes reasoning about code easier
- Enables powerful optimizations
