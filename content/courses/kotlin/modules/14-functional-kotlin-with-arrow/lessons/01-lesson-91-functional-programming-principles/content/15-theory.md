- **Pure functions** are predictable, testable, and cacheable
- **Immutability** eliminates bugs from shared mutable state
- **Function composition** builds complex behavior from simple parts
- **Referential transparency** enables safe refactoring and optimization
- Use **data classes with copy()** for immutable updates
- Prefer **sequences** for large collection transformations
- FP is about **clarity and correctness**, not complexity
