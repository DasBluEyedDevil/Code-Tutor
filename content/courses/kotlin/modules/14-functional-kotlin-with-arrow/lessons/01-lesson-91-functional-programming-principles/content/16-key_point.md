**Functional programming emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and composition**. Pure functions produce the same output for the same input without side effects—this makes code predictable, testable, and parallelizable.

**Immutability eliminates entire categories of bugs**—no race conditions, no unexpected state changes, no mutation-related surprises. Once created, data structures never change; transformations create new instances.

**FP is not all-or-nothing**—apply functional principles where they add value (data transformations, error handling) while using imperative code where appropriate (I/O, UI updates). Kotlin supports both paradigms.
