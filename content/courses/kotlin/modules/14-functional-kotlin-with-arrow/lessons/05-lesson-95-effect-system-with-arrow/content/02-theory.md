Arrow 1.2+ introduces a powerful effect system based on `Raise<E>`. This provides an alternative to returning `Either<E, A>` that feels more like writing imperative code while maintaining functional safety.

In this lesson, you'll learn:
- Understanding `Raise<E>` for effect-based error handling
- Using `ensure` and `ensureNotNull`
- Composing effects with the `either { }` builder
- Integrating effects with coroutines
