  "description": "Create a function that fetches data from three 'API endpoints' (simulated with delay) in parallel and returns the combined result. The function should complete in approximately 1000ms, not 2400ms.",
  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "hints": [
    "Use async { } to start each fetch concurrently",
    "Use coroutineScope { } to create a scope for your async calls",
    "Call .await() on each Deferred to get the results",
    "The total time should be the max of individual times, not the sum"
  ],
  "testCases": [
    {
      "description": "Should complete in approximately 1000ms (not 2400ms)",
      "expectedBehavior": "Time should be around 1000-1100ms since all three run in parallel"
