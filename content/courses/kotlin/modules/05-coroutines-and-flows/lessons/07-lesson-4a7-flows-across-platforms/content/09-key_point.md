**Flows work identically across all Kotlin platforms**—JVM, Android, iOS, JS, and Native. Write your reactive business logic once in commonMain and share it across all targets without platform-specific adapters.

**Platform-specific collectors integrate with native reactive systems**: Combine/SwiftUI on iOS, RxJava on Android, Promises in JavaScript. The bridge layer is thin and predictable.

**This module completes your coroutines and Flows mastery**—you can now write structured, cancellation-aware, exception-safe asynchronous code that scales from single operations to complex reactive systems across all platforms.
