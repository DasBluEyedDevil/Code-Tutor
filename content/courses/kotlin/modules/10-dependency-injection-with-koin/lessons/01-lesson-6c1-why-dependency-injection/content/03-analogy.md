**Without DI (Bad Coffee Shop):**
The barista (your class) runs to the warehouse to get beans, drives to get milk, and builds their own espresso machine. They need to know everything about sourcing.

**With DI (Good Coffee Shop):**
The barista receives beans, milk, and an espresso machine when they start work. They focus on making great coffee. If the shop switches milk suppliers, the barista's job doesn't change.

**Your class should receive its tools, not create them.**
