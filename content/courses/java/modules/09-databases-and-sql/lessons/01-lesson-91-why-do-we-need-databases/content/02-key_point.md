title: "Databases are Like Libraries"

Your program's memory (variables) = Your desk
- Fast access
- Limited space
- Temporary (clear when you leave)

A database = A library
- Massive storage
- Organized (card catalog)
- Permanent (survives computer shutdowns)
- Shared (multiple programs can access)

You work with data on your desk (RAM), but save important things to the library (database).
