title: "Maven is Like a Restaurant Manager"
---

WITHOUT MAVEN (You're a cook doing everything):
- Buy ingredients yourself
- Track which suppliers have what
- Check if ingredients are compatible
- Organize kitchen yourself
- Cook AND manage

WITH MAVEN (Restaurant manager):
- You tell manager: "I need tomatoes, version 2.0"
- Manager orders from suppliers
- Manager organizes kitchen layout
- Manager ensures everything's in the right place
- You just focus on cooking (coding)

Maven handles the boring project management stuff!
