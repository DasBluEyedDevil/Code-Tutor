1. FEWER BUGS
   - Tests written first catch issues immediately
   - You think through edge cases upfront

2. BETTER DESIGN
   - Code is automatically testable
   - Forces you to write modular, decoupled code

3. LIVING DOCUMENTATION
   - Tests show how to use your code
   - Examples of every feature

4. CONFIDENCE TO REFACTOR
   - Change code freely
   - Tests verify nothing broke

5. LESS DEBUGGING
   - Catch bugs in seconds, not hours
   - Know exactly what's broken

Professional developers use TDD for critical code.
