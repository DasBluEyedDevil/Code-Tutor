BUILDING WITHOUT BLUEPRINT (traditional):
- Start nailing boards together
- Hope it looks like a house
- Realize door is in wrong place
- Tear down, rebuild

BUILDING WITH BLUEPRINT (TDD):
- Draw blueprint first (the test)
- Blueprint shows exactly what you need
- Build to match blueprint
- Verify it matches blueprint

TDD TESTS = Blueprints for your code
They specify EXACTLY what the code should do BEFORE you write it.
