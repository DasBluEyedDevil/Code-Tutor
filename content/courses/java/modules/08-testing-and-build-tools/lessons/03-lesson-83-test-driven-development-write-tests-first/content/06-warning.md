AVOID THESE TDD PITFALLS:

1. WRITING TOO MUCH CODE AT ONCE
   Only write code to pass the CURRENT test.

2. SKIPPING THE REFACTOR STEP
   Clean code is as important as working code.

3. TESTING IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
   Test BEHAVIOR, not internal structure.

4. NOT RUNNING TESTS FREQUENTLY
   Run tests after every small change.

5. WRITING TESTS THAT DEPEND ON EACH OTHER
   Each test should be independent.

Good TDD: Small steps, frequent feedback.
