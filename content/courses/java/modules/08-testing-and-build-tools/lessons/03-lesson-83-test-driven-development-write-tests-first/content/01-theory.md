TYPICAL development workflow:

1. Write code
2. Run it, see if it works
3. Find bugs
4. Fix bugs
5. Maybe write tests later (if you have time)

PROBLEMS:
❌ Tests are an afterthought
❌ You might forget edge cases
❌ Code might be hard to test (not designed for it)
❌ Tests often get skipped ("no time")

What if there was a BETTER way?
