Instead of println, use your IDE's DEBUGGER:

KEY FEATURES:

1. BREAKPOINTS
   - Click next to line number (red dot appears)
   - Program PAUSES when it reaches that line
   - Inspect ALL variables at that moment

2. STEP THROUGH CODE
   - Step Over: Execute current line, move to next
   - Step Into: Go inside method call
   - Step Out: Finish current method, return to caller

3. WATCH VARIABLES
   - See how variables change
   - Evaluate expressions on-the-fly

4. CALL STACK
   - See path of method calls
   - Navigate to any point

DEBUGGING WORKFLOW:
1. Set breakpoint where problem might be
2. Run in debug mode
3. When paused, inspect variables
4. Step through code line by line
5. Watch how values change
6. Identify where logic goes wrong
