title: "Logging vs Debugging"
---

LOGGING = Security cameras:
- Always recording
- Review footage after incident
- See what happened over time
- Good for: production issues, patterns

Example:
"Why did the server crash at 3am?"
→ Check logs for ERROR messages at that time

DEBUGGING = Live investigation:
- Stop and examine everything NOW
- Step-by-step analysis
- Immediate feedback
- Good for: development, understanding flow

Example:
"Why is calculateTotal() returning wrong value?"
→ Set breakpoint, inspect variables, step through logic

USE BOTH!
