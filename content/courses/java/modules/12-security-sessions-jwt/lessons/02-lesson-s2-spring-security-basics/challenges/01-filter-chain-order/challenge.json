  "question": "Given this configuration:\n.requestMatchers(\"/api/**\").authenticated()\n.requestMatchers(\"/api/public\").permitAll()\nWhat happens when an unauthenticated user accesses /api/public?",
  "options": [
    "Access granted - permitAll() applies",
    "Access denied - /api/** rule matches first",
    "Error - conflicting rules",
    "Redirected to login - needs authentication"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "Authorization rules are evaluated top-to-bottom, first match wins. '/api/**' matches '/api/public' before the specific rule is reached. The request requires authentication. To allow public access, put the specific rule FIRST: .requestMatchers(\"/api/public\").permitAll() then .requestMatchers(\"/api/**\").authenticated()",
