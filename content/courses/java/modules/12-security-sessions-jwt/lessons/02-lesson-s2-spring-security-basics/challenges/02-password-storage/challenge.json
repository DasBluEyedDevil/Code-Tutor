  "question": "Why is BCrypt preferred over SHA-256 for password hashing?",
  "options": [
    "BCrypt produces longer hashes",
    "BCrypt is intentionally slow and includes salting",
    "BCrypt is newer and therefore better",
    "BCrypt uses symmetric encryption"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "BCrypt is designed for passwords: it's intentionally slow (configurable work factor) to resist brute force, and includes automatic salting to prevent rainbow table attacks. SHA-256 is fast (good for data integrity, bad for passwords) and requires manual salt management. Speed is a liability for password hashing.",
