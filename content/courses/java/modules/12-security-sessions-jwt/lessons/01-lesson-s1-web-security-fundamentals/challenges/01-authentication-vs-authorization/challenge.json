    "Authorization - the user lacks permission for that resource",
    "Encryption - the request wasn't properly secured",
    "Input validation - the URL was malformed"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The user successfully logged in (authentication passed), but lacks admin permissions (authorization failed). Authentication verifies WHO you are; authorization determines WHAT you can access. Here, the user is authenticated but not authorized for the admin dashboard.",
