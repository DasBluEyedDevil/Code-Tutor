The moment you deploy a web application, you become a target:

REAL STATISTICS (2024):
- 30,000+ websites hacked DAILY
- Average data breach cost: $4.45 million
- 43% of attacks target small businesses
- 60% of breached companies close within 6 months

Common attack scenarios:

1. CREDENTIAL STUFFING:
Attacker uses leaked username/password pairs from other breaches.
Result: Unauthorized access to user accounts.

2. SESSION HIJACKING:
Attacker steals session cookie.
Result: Impersonates logged-in user without knowing password.

3. SQL INJECTION:
Attacker enters: ' OR '1'='1' -- in login form.
Result: Bypasses authentication entirely.

4. CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS):
Attacker injects malicious JavaScript.
Result: Steals cookies, redirects users, defaces site.

Security isn't optional - it's survival.
