  "question": "In Spring Security, what is the relationship between hasRole('ADMIN') and hasAuthority('ROLE_ADMIN')?",
  "options": [
    "hasRole is for URL security, hasAuthority is for method security",
    "They are equivalent - hasRole adds the ROLE_ prefix automatically",
    "hasAuthority provides encryption, hasRole does not",
    "hasRole checks database, hasAuthority checks JWT"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "hasRole('ADMIN') and hasAuthority('ROLE_ADMIN') are equivalent. Spring Security automatically prefixes 'ROLE_' when using hasRole(). This is a convention - roles use the prefix, while authorities (fine-grained permissions like 'user:read') typically don't. Use hasRole for job functions, hasAuthority for specific permissions.",
