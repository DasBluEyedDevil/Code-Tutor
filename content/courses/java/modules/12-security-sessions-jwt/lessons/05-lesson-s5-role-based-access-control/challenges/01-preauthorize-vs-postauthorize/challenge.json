  "title": "@PreAuthorize vs @PostAuthorize",
  "description": "Understanding when to use each annotation",
  "question": "When should you use @PostAuthorize instead of @PreAuthorize?",
  "options": [
    "When you need better performance",
    "When authorization depends on the returned object's properties",
    "When checking multiple roles",
    "When using JWT authentication"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "@PostAuthorize runs AFTER the method executes, so you can access the return value. Use it when authorization depends on the returned object (e.g., 'user can only see their own document'). @PreAuthorize runs before and is preferred when you don't need the return value, as it fails fast without executing potentially expensive operations.",
