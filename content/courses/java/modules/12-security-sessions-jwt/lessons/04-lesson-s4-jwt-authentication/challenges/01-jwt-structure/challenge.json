  "description": "Understanding JWT components",
  "question": "Which JWT component prevents an attacker from modifying the payload (e.g., changing roles from USER to ADMIN)?",
  "options": [
    "Header - specifies the encryption algorithm",
    "Payload - contains the user claims",
    "Signature - cryptographic proof of integrity",
    "Base64 encoding - obscures the content"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The signature is created by hashing (header + payload) with a secret key. If an attacker modifies the payload, they can't create a valid signature without the secret. When the server validates, it recalculates the signature and compares - modified tokens fail validation. Base64 is encoding, not security.",
