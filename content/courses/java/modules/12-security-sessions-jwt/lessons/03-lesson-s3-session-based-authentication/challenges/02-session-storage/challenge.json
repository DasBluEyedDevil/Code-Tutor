  "question": "Your application runs on 4 servers behind a load balancer. Users report being randomly logged out. What's the most likely cause and best solution?",
  "options": [
    "Session timeout too short - increase timeout",
    "Sessions stored in server memory - use Redis for shared storage",
    "CSRF tokens expiring - disable CSRF protection",
    "Cookies blocked by browser - use URL session IDs"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "With in-memory sessions and multiple servers, users get logged out when the load balancer routes them to a different server than the one holding their session. The solution is centralized session storage (Redis, database) that all servers can access. Sticky sessions are a workaround but don't handle server failures.",
  "difficulty": "intermediate"
