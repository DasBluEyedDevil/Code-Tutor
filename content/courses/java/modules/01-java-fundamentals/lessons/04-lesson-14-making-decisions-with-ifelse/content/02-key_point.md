Imagine you're walking and you reach a fork in the road. There's a sign that says:

"If it's raining → Go left to the covered path"
"Otherwise → Go right to the scenic route"

You CHECK the condition ("Is it raining?"), and based on the answer (yes/no), you take a different path.

In Java:

if (it's raining) {
    take the covered path
} else {
    take the scenic route
}

The computer CHECKS the condition in parentheses. If it's true, it runs the code inside the first curly braces. If it's false, it runs the code inside the 'else' block.
