So far, your programs do the same thing every time. They print the same message, calculate the same numbers. But what if you need a program that ADAPTS based on the situation?

Examples:
- A game that says "You win!" if score > 100, but "Try again" if score < 100
- A program that checks if you're old enough to vote
- A calculator that prevents division by zero

You need a way to make the computer ASK A QUESTION and then DO DIFFERENT THINGS based on the answer.

This is called CONDITIONAL LOGIC, and in Java, we use 'if' statements.
