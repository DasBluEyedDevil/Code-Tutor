A computer program is:

1. A SEQUENCE OF INSTRUCTIONS (step 1, step 2, step 3...)
2. WRITTEN IN A LANGUAGE THE COMPUTER UNDERSTANDS (like Java, Python, C++)
3. THAT MANIPULATES DATA (numbers, text, images)
4. TO PRODUCE A RESULT (a calculation, a webpage, a video game)

Breaking it down:

Instructions: Computers execute instructions one at a time, in order. Examples:
• "Store the number 5 in a box"
• "Add 3 to whatever is in the box"
• "Show the result on the screen"

Language: Computers don't understand English. They understand machine code (0s and 1s). But writing in 0s and 1s is torture, so we use programming languages like Java, which look more like English. Java gets translated into machine code automatically.

Data: Programs work with information: numbers, text, images, videos, sounds.

Results: Every program has a purpose—calculating, displaying, storing, or transforming data.
