Let's compare a recipe for humans vs. a recipe for a computer:

Recipe for a Human:
1. Preheat oven to 350°F
2. Mix the ingredients
3. Bake for 20 minutes

Why this works: Humans know what "mix" means. They know ovens have dials.

Recipe for a Computer:
1. LOCATE the oven dial
2. TURN the dial clockwise until display shows 350
3. WAIT until the light labeled "READY" turns green
4. OPEN the ingredient_box
5. FOR EACH item in ingredient_box:
   a. MEASURE the item using measuring_cup
   b. POUR into bowl labeled "mixing_bowl"
6. PICK UP the spoon labeled "mixing_spoon"
7. MOVE spoon in circular motion for 60 seconds
8. PLACE mixing_bowl into oven
9. START timer for 20 minutes
10. WAIT until timer beeps

Notice: Every action is explicit. Every object is identified. No assumptions are made.

This is programming. You're writing a recipe so detailed that something with ZERO intelligence can follow it perfectly.
