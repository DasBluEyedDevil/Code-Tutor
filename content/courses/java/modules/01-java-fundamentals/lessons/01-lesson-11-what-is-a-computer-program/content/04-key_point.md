Computers CANNOT:
✗ Guess what you meant
✗ Improvise or adapt
✗ Understand context
✗ Learn without being programmed to learn

But computers CAN:
✓ Follow instructions perfectly, billions of times per second
✓ Remember massive amounts of data flawlessly
✓ Repeat tasks without getting tired or bored
✓ Do exactly what you tell them, every single time

Your job as a programmer: Be the smart one. Give the instructions. The computer will be the obedient one.
