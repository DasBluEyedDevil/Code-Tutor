Imagine you're trying to teach your younger sibling how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You leave the kitchen for 5 minutes and return to find:

• The peanut butter jar is unopened
• They spread jelly on the outside of the bread
• The knife is on the floor
• They're confused why it didn't work

What went wrong? You assumed they knew things: "spread" means using a knife, "on the bread" means the inside face, you need to open jars first. But your sibling followed your words EXACTLY as you said them—no more, no less.

THIS IS HOW COMPUTERS WORK.

A computer is the most obedient, most literal "sibling" imaginable. It will do exactly what you tell it—nothing more, nothing less. It has zero common sense. It can't guess what you meant. It can't improvise.
