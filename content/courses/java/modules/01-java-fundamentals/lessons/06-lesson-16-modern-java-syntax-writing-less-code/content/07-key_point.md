title: "When to Use These Features"
---

USE COMPACT SOURCE FILES WHEN:
- Learning Java
- Writing quick scripts
- Building small utilities
- Prototyping ideas

USE FULL CLASS SYNTAX WHEN:
- Building multi-class applications
- Working on team projects with established conventions
- Creating reusable libraries
- Need explicit class structure

USE UNNAMED _ WHEN:
- Variable is required but unused
- Catch blocks where exception details don't matter
- Loop counters you don't need

USE MODULE IMPORTS WHEN:
- Learning/prototyping
- Need many classes from java.base
- Explicit imports become tedious

BEST PRACTICE: Start simple with these features, then add structure as your program grows.
