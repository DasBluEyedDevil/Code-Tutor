Once you create a variable, you can:

1. PRINT IT:
   int age = 25;
   System.out.println(age);  // Prints: 25

2. CHANGE IT:
   age = 30;  // Now the box contains 30

3. DO MATH WITH IT:
   int score = 100;
   score = score + 10;  // Now score is 110

4. COMBINE IT WITH TEXT:
   System.out.println("Your score is: " + score);
   // Prints: Your score is: 110

The '+' symbol does different things:
- With numbers: adds them (5 + 3 = 8)
- With text: joins them ("Hello" + "World" = "HelloWorld")
