To create a variable, you need THREE things:

1. TYPE: What kind of data will the box hold? (number? text? true/false?)
2. NAME: What should we call this box?
3. VALUE: What should we put inside?

The syntax:
type name = value;

Examples:

int age = 25;
  ↑    ↑    ↑
 type name value

Breaking it down:
- 'int' means 'integer' (a whole number)
- 'age' is the name we chose
- '25' is the value we're storing
- ';' ends the statement (like a period)

More examples:
int score = 100;           // Whole number
double price = 19.99;      // Decimal number
String name = "Alice";    // Text (must use quotes!)
boolean isActive = true;   // true or false

Key rule: Once you declare a variable with a type, that box can ONLY hold that type of data.
