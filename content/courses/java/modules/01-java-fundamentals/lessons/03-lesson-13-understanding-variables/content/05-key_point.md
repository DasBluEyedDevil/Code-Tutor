You can name variables almost anything, BUT:

✓ DO:
- Use descriptive names: 'playerScore' not 'x'
- Start with a lowercase letter: 'score', 'myAge'
- Use camelCase for multiple words: 'highScore', 'userName'

✗ DON'T:
- Use spaces: 'my age' is WRONG, use 'myAge'
- Start with a number: '2cool' is WRONG, use 'cool2'
- Use special characters: 'score$' is usually wrong
- Use Java keywords: 'int', 'class', 'public' are reserved

Good names: age, playerScore, userName, totalCost
Bad names: a, x, asdfghjkl, thing123
