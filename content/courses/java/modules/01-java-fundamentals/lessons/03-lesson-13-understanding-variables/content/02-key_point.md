Imagine you have a storage room with boxes. Each box:

1. Has a LABEL on it (the variable name) like 'age' or 'score'
2. Can hold ONE thing inside (the value)
3. You can CHANGE what's inside anytime
4. You can LOOK inside to see what's stored

Example:
- Box labeled 'playerScore' contains: 100
- Box labeled 'playerName' contains: 'Alex'
- Box labeled 'isGameOver' contains: false

In Java, when you create a variable, you're saying:
"Computer, create a box, label it with this name, and put this value inside."

The computer reserves a tiny spot in its memory (RAM) for that box.
