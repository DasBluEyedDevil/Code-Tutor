title: "Your First Java Program"

In Java 25+, writing your first program is simple:

void main() {
    println("Hello, World!");
}

That's it! Just 3 lines. Let's break it down:
- void main() - the entry point of your program
- println() - prints text to the console
- The semicolon ';' ends the instruction (like a period ends a sentence)

KEY RULE: Java is case-sensitive. 'Main' and 'main' are different. Be precise!
