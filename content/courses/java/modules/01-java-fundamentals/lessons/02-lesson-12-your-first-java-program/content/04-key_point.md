title: "Which Syntax Should You Use?"

You'll see TWO styles of Java code in the real world:

MODERN SYNTAX (Java 23+):
void main() {
    println("Hello, World!");
}

Use this when: Learning, prototyping, or using Java 23+.

TRADITIONAL SYNTAX (Java 8-21 LTS):
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

Use this when: Working in enterprise codebases, using Java 21 LTS, or in job interviews.

IMPORTANT: According to the 2025 Java Developer Report, 61% of developers use Java 17 and 45% use Java 21 LTS. You MUST recognize both syntaxes!

This course teaches modern syntax first (it's simpler to learn!) but ALWAYS shows the traditional equivalent. When you see code at work or in tutorials, you'll know exactly what's happening.
