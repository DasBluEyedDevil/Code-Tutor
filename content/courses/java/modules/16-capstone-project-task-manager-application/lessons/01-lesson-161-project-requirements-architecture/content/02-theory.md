title: "User Stories and Requirements"

Every professional project starts with clear requirements. We will define ours through user stories - descriptions of features from the user's perspective.

Authentication Stories:
- As a new user, I want to register with my email and password so that I can access the application.
- As a registered user, I want to log in securely so that I can manage my tasks.
- As a logged-in user, I want to log out so that my session is terminated securely.
- As a user, I want my password stored securely (hashed) so that my account is protected.

Task Management Stories:
- As a user, I want to create tasks with a title, description, due date, and priority so that I can track my work.
- As a user, I want to view all my tasks in a list so that I can see what needs to be done.
- As a user, I want to edit my tasks so that I can update information as things change.
- As a user, I want to delete tasks I no longer need so that my list stays clean.
- As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete so that I can track my progress.
- As a user, I want to filter tasks by status (pending, completed) so that I can focus on what matters.
- As a user, I want to sort tasks by due date or priority so that I can prioritize effectively.

Category Management Stories:
- As a user, I want to create categories (Work, Personal, Health, etc.) so that I can organize my tasks.
- As a user, I want to assign tasks to categories so that related tasks are grouped together.
- As a user, I want to filter tasks by category so that I can focus on one area at a time.

These user stories will guide our development. Each feature we build should directly support one or more of these stories. This is how professional teams work - requirements drive development.
