title: "Introduction to the Task Manager Project"
---

Welcome to the capstone project! Over the next 9 lessons, you will build a complete, production-ready Task Manager application from scratch. This is not a toy project -- it is a full-stack application that demonstrates every skill you have learned throughout this course.

The Task Manager allows users to organize their work through tasks, categories, and priorities. Users can register, log in securely, create and manage tasks, organize them by category, set due dates, and track their progress. The backend is built with Spring Boot 4.0.x and Java 25, backed by a PostgreSQL database.

Choose Your Frontend Path:
This capstone offers two frontend approaches. You will choose one based on your interests and comfort level:
- Thymeleaf Path (Server-Side Rendering): Build the frontend entirely in Java using Spring MVC and Thymeleaf templates. This is the simpler path -- no separate frontend project, no JavaScript framework to learn, and deployment is a single JAR. Perfect if you want to stay in the Java ecosystem.
- React Path (Client-Side Rendering): Build a separate React frontend that communicates with the Spring Boot REST API. This is the advanced path that gives you experience with modern JavaScript frameworks, API integration, and multi-service deployment.

Both paths share the same Spring Boot backend (Lessons 01-05). You diverge at Lesson 06 where you choose your frontend approach.

Why a Task Manager? This project type is perfect for demonstrating your skills because it requires:
- User authentication and authorization (security)
- CRUD operations on multiple related entities (database design)
- Complex business logic (task filtering, sorting, status updates)
- A responsive user interface (frontend development)
- RESTful API design (backend architecture)
- Real-world deployment concerns (Docker, CI/CD)

By the end of this capstone, you will have a portfolio-worthy project that showcases your ability to build complete applications. Employers specifically look for projects that demonstrate end-to-end thinking -- and this project does exactly that.

Let us begin by understanding what we are building and how all the pieces fit together.
