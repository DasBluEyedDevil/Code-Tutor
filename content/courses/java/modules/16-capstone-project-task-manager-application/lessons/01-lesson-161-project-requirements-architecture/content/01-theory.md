title: "Introduction to the Task Manager Project"
---

Welcome to the capstone project! Over the next 9 lessons, you will build a complete, production-ready Task Manager application from scratch. This is not a toy project - it is a full-stack application that demonstrates every skill you have learned throughout this course.

The Task Manager allows users to organize their work through tasks, categories, and priorities. Users can register, log in securely, create and manage tasks, organize them by category, set due dates, and track their progress. The application features a modern React frontend communicating with a Spring Boot REST API, all backed by a PostgreSQL database.

Why a Task Manager? This project type is perfect for demonstrating your skills because it requires:
- User authentication and authorization (security)
- CRUD operations on multiple related entities (database design)
- Complex business logic (task filtering, sorting, status updates)
- A responsive user interface (frontend development)
- RESTful API design (backend architecture)
- Real-world deployment concerns (Docker, CI/CD)

By the end of this capstone, you will have a portfolio-worthy project that showcases your ability to build complete applications. Employers specifically look for projects that demonstrate end-to-end thinking - and this project does exactly that.

Let us begin by understanding what we are building and how all the pieces fit together.
