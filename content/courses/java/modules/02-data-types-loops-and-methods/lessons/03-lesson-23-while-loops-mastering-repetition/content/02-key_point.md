Remember the game "Simon Says"?

"Keep jumping while I'm clapping"

You KEEP jumping (repeating the action) WHILE the condition (clapping) is true.
When the clapping stops (condition becomes false), you stop jumping.

A while loop works the same way:

while (condition is true) {
    keep doing this
}

Another analogy: Brushing your teeth

while (teeth are dirty) {
    brush teeth;
}

You keep brushing WHILE the condition (teeth are dirty) is true.
Once your teeth are clean (condition is false), you stop.
