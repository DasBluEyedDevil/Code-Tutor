title: "Methods are Like Vending Machine Buttons"
---

Think of a vending machine:

1. You press button "A1"
2. The machine runs a sequence: move arm → grab item → drop item
3. You get your snack

You don't need to know HOW the machine works internally. You just press the button (call the method) and get the result.

In programming:

calculateTax(100)  ← Press the button (input: 100)
↓ Internal magic happens
Returns: 8  ← You get the result

A method is a button with a name. When you "press" it (call it), it runs some code and can give you back a result.

Another analogy: A recipe
Recipe name: "Make Pancakes"
Inputs (ingredients): flour, eggs, milk
Steps: mix, cook, flip
Output: delicious pancakes

makePancakes(flour, eggs, milk) → pancakes
