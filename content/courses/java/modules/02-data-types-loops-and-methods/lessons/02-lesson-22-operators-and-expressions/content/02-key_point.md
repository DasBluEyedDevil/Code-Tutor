title: "Operators are Calculator Buttons"
---

Imagine a calculator:

You press: 5 [+] 3 [=]
Result: 8

In Java:
int result = 5 + 3;  // result is 8

The '+' is an OPERATOR. It takes two values (5 and 3) and produces a result (8).

Just like a calculator has buttons for +, -, ×, ÷, Java has operator symbols:
+ for addition
- for subtraction
* for multiplication (can't use × symbol!)
/ for division
% for remainder (modulo)
