Java provides shortcuts for common patterns:

1. INCREMENT (add 1)
   int score = 10;
   score++;  // Same as: score = score + 1
   // score is now 11

2. DECREMENT (subtract 1)
   int lives = 3;
   lives--;  // Same as: lives = lives - 1
   // lives is now 2

3. COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT
   int x = 10;
   x += 5;   // Same as: x = x + 5  (x is 15)
   x -= 3;   // Same as: x = x - 3  (x is 12)
   x *= 2;   // Same as: x = x * 2  (x is 24)
   x /= 4;   // Same as: x = x / 4  (x is 6)

These are VERY common in real code!
