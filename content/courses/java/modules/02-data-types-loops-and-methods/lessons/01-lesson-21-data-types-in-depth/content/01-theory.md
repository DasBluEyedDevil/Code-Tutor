You've learned that variables store information. But not all information is the same:

• Your age: a whole number (25)
• Your bank balance: a decimal number (1,234.56)
• Your name: text ("Alice")
• Whether you're logged in: true or false

Java needs to know WHAT KIND of data each variable holds because:
1. Different types use different amounts of memory
2. Different types support different operations (you can't multiply text!)
3. This prevents bugs (accidentally treating a number as text)

Think of it like containers: you wouldn't store soup in a paper bag or carry books in a bucket. The container (type) must match what you're storing (data).
