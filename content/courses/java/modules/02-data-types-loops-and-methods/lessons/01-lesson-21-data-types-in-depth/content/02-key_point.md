In a kitchen, you have different containers for different things:

🥛 Glass (int) - For whole items: 5 apples, 12 eggs, 100 cookies
   Can't hold half items. Either you have 5 apples or 6, not 5.5.

🍶 Measuring Cup (double) - For liquids: 2.5 cups of water, 1.75 liters
   Can hold precise decimal amounts.

📝 Label Maker (String) - For text: "Flour", "Sugar", "Hello World"
   Stores words and sentences.

🔲 Checkbox (boolean) - For yes/no: oven on? true/false
   Only two possible values: true or false.

Each container (data type) is designed for a specific purpose!
