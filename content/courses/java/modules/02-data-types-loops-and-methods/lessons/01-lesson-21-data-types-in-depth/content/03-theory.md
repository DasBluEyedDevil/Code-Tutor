title: "The Four Essential Data Types"
---

Java has several data types, but beginners need to master these four:

1. int (INTEGER - whole numbers)
   int age = 25;
   int score = -10;  // Can be negative
   int population = 8000000;
   Range: -2 billion to +2 billion (approximately)
   Use for: counts, ages, scores, quantities

2. double (DECIMAL NUMBERS)
   double price = 19.99;
   double temperature = -3.5;
   double pi = 3.14159;
   Use for: money, measurements, scientific calculations
   Note: Called 'double' because it uses double the memory of old 'float' type

3. String (TEXT)
   String name = "Alice";
   String message = "Hello, World!";
   String empty = "";  // Empty string
   MUST use double quotes: "like this"
   Note: String is capitalized (it's technically an object, not primitive)

4. boolean (TRUE/FALSE)
   boolean isLoggedIn = true;
   boolean gameOver = false;
   boolean hasWon = score > 100;
   Only two values: true or false (lowercase!)
   Use for: flags, conditions, yes/no questions
