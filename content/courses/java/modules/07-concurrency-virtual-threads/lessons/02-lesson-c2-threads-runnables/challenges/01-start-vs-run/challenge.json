  "question": "What happens when you call thread.run() instead of thread.start()?",
  "options": [
    "The thread runs faster because there's no setup overhead",
    "The run() method executes on the CURRENT thread, not a new thread",
    "An IllegalThreadStateException is thrown",
    "The thread runs in the background"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "Calling run() directly just invokes the method on the current thread like any normal method call. No new thread is created. You must call start() to create a new thread that then invokes run(). This is a common beginner mistake.",
