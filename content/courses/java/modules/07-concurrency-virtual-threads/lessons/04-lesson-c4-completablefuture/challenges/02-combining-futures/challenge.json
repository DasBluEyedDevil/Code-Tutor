  "description": "Understanding how to combine multiple futures",
  "question": "You need to fetch data from 3 independent APIs concurrently and proceed only when ALL complete. Which method do you use?",
  "options": [
    "thenCombine - combines two futures into one",
    "anyOf - completes when any future completes",
    "allOf - completes when all futures complete",
    "thenCompose - chains futures sequentially"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "CompletableFuture.allOf(cf1, cf2, cf3) returns a future that completes when ALL input futures complete. anyOf completes when ANY single future completes. thenCombine only works with exactly two futures. thenCompose is for sequential chaining, not parallel.",
  "difficulty": "advanced"
