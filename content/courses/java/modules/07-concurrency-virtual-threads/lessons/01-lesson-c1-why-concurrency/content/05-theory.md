Java's concurrency has evolved dramatically:

JAVA 1.0 (1996): Basic Threads
- Thread class, synchronized keyword
- Low-level, error-prone

JAVA 5 (2004): java.util.concurrent
- ExecutorService, thread pools
- Concurrent collections
- Locks, semaphores, barriers

JAVA 8 (2014): CompletableFuture
- Async programming with callbacks
- Composable futures
- Parallel streams

JAVA 21 (2023): Virtual Threads
- Lightweight threads (millions possible!)
- Simple blocking code, high scalability
- Game changer for I/O-bound applications

This module covers it all, culminating in virtual threads - the biggest concurrency innovation since Java 5.
