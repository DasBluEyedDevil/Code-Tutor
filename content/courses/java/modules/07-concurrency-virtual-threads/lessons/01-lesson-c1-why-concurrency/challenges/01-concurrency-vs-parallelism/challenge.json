    "Parallelism only",
    "Concurrency only",
    "Both concurrency and parallelism",
    "Neither concurrency nor parallelism"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "This is concurrency without parallelism. The CPU switches between tasks (concurrency), but only one task runs at any instant (no parallelism). Parallelism requires multiple cores executing simultaneously. Concurrency is about structure (handling multiple tasks); parallelism is about execution (running simultaneously).",
