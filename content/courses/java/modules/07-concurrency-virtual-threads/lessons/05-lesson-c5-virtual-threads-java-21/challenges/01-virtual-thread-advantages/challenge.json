  "question": "A service handles 10,000 concurrent HTTP requests, each waiting 100ms for a database response. What's the main advantage of virtual threads over a 200-thread platform pool?",
  "options": [
    "Virtual threads are faster at executing code",
    "Virtual threads can handle all 10,000 concurrently without blocking other requests",
    "Virtual threads use more memory for better caching",
    "Virtual threads don't need a thread pool"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "With 200 platform threads, only 200 requests run concurrently - others queue. Each request takes 100ms on I/O, so throughput is ~2000/sec. Virtual threads allow all 10,000 to proceed concurrently - when one blocks on I/O, its carrier thread runs others. Result: ~100ms total instead of 500ms.",
