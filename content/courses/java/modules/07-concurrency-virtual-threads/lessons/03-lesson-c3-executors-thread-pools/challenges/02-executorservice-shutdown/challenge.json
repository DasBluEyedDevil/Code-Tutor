  "description": "Understanding proper executor lifecycle",
  "question": "What happens if you never call shutdown() on an ExecutorService?",
  "options": [
    "The executor automatically shuts down when all tasks complete",
    "The JVM never exits because executor threads are still alive",
    "A memory leak occurs but the program can still exit",
    "An exception is thrown after 60 seconds"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "ExecutorService threads are non-daemon by default. The JVM won't exit while non-daemon threads are alive. Your program will hang indefinitely until you call shutdown(). Always shutdown executors in a finally block or use try-with-resources (Java 19+).",
  "difficulty": "intermediate"
