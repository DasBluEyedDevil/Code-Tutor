  "description": "Understanding which thread pool to use",
  "question": "You're building a web server that needs to handle HTTP requests. Each request involves I/O (database, external APIs) and you expect up to 1000 concurrent requests. Which pool type is MOST appropriate?",
  "options": [
    "Executors.newCachedThreadPool() - creates threads as needed",
    "Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor() - sequential processing",
    "Executors.newFixedThreadPool(n) - bounded pool",
    "No pool needed - create new Thread for each request"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "For I/O-bound workloads with high concurrency, use a fixed thread pool. CachedThreadPool could create 1000+ threads, exhausting memory. SingleThread would be too slow. Raw threads have no reuse. A fixed pool with appropriately sized thread count (or virtual threads in Java 21+) is ideal.",
