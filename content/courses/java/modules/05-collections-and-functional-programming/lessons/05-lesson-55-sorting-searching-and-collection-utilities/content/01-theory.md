title: "The Problem: Collections Need Common Operations"

You've learned:
- ArrayList for dynamic lists
- HashMap for key-value pairs
- LinkedList for queue-like structures

But you often need to:
- SORT a list (alphabetically, numerically)
- SEARCH for an element
- SHUFFLE elements
- Find MAX/MIN values
- REVERSE order

Good news: Java provides Collections utility class with methods for all of this!
