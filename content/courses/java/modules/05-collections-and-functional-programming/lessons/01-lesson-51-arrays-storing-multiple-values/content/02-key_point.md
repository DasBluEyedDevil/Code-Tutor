title: "Arrays are Like a Row of Numbered Boxes"
---

Imagine a row of mail boxes in an apartment building:

[Box 0] [Box 1] [Box 2] [Box 3] [Box 4]

Each box:
- Holds ONE item
- Has a NUMBER (index)
- Contains the SAME TYPE of thing

In Java:
int[] scores = new int[5];
scores[0] = 85;  // Put 85 in box 0
scores[1] = 92;  // Put 92 in box 1

⚠️ Arrays start at index 0, not 1!
