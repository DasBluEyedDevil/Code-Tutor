title: "The Problem: Users Need Interfaces"
---

Your Spring Boot API is amazing:
- GET /api/users returns user data
- POST /api/users creates users

But normal users don't type URLs and read JSON!

They need:
- Buttons to click
- Forms to fill out
- Visual displays

This is where FRONTEND comes in:
- HTML (structure)
- CSS (styling)
- JavaScript (interactivity)
