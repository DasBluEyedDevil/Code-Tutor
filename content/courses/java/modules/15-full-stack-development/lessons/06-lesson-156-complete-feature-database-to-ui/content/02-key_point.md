DATABASE (The land/foundation):
Where everything is stored permanently

Like: Highway specifications (lanes, width, materials)

REPOSITORY (The construction crew):
Builds, reads, updates, destroys database records
Like: Workers who build and maintain the roads

SERVICE (Traffic management):
Business rules (e.g., can't delete someone else's task)
Like: Traffic laws and management systems

CONTROLLER (Toll booths/entrances):
Where requests come in and responses go out
Like: Highway entrances/exits with toll systems

FRONTEND (The cars and drivers):
What users actually see and interact with
Like: People driving cars on the highway

All parts must work together!
