So far, your programs run on ONE computer.

But modern apps need to:
- Let users access from anywhere (phone, laptop, tablet)
- Share data between users
- Update in real-time

Example: Instagram
- You post a photo from your phone
- Your friend sees it on their laptop
- How did the photo get there?

This requires CLIENT-SERVER architecture.
