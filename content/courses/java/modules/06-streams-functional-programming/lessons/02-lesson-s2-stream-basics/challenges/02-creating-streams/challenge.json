    "Stream.of(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")",
    "Arrays.stream(new int[]{1, 2, 3})",
    "new Stream<>(1, 2, 3)"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 3,
  "explanation": "Stream is an interface, not a class, so you cannot instantiate it with 'new'. Use factory methods like stream() on collections, Stream.of() for values, or Arrays.stream() for arrays.",
