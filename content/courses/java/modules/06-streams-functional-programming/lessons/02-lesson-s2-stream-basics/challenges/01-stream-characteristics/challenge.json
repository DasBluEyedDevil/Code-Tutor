  "question": "What happens when you call filter() on a stream?",
  "options": [
    "It immediately filters the elements and returns a new list",
    "It stores the filter condition and returns a new stream, executing only when a terminal operation is called",
    "It modifies the original collection in place",
    "It throws an exception if no elements match"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "Stream operations are lazy - intermediate operations like filter() don't execute immediately. They build up a pipeline that only executes when a terminal operation (like collect(), count(), or forEach()) is called. This allows for optimizations like short-circuiting.",
  "difficulty": "intermediate"
