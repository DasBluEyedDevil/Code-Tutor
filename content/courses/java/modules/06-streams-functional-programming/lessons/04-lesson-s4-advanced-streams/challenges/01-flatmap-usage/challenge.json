  "question": "You have a List<String> of sentences and want to get a stream of individual words. Which approach is correct?",
  "options": [
    "sentences.stream().map(s -> s.split(\" \"))",
    "sentences.stream().flatMap(s -> Arrays.stream(s.split(\" \")))",
    "sentences.stream().filter(s -> s.split(\" \"))",
    "sentences.stream().reduce(s -> s.split(\" \"))"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "flatMap is used when you want to transform each element into multiple elements and flatten the result. map(s -> s.split(\" \")) would give you Stream<String[]>, but flatMap with Arrays.stream gives you Stream<String> - all words in a single flat stream.",
  "difficulty": "intermediate"
