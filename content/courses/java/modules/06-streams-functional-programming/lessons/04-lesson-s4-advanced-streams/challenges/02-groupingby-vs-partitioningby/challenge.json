  "question": "What is the key difference between groupingBy and partitioningBy?",
  "options": [
    "partitioningBy is faster than groupingBy",
    "groupingBy can only group by String keys",
    "partitioningBy always returns exactly two groups (true/false), groupingBy can return any number of groups",
    "partitioningBy modifies the original collection"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "partitioningBy uses a Predicate and always returns a Map with exactly two keys: true and false. groupingBy uses a classifier function and can return any number of groups based on the key values. Use partitioningBy for binary splits, groupingBy for multi-category grouping.",
  "difficulty": "intermediate"
