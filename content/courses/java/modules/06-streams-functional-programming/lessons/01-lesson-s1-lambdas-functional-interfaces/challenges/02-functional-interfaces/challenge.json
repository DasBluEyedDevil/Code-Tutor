  "description": "Understanding which functional interface to use",
  "question": "You need a function that takes a String and returns a boolean indicating if it's valid. Which functional interface should you use?",
  "options": [
    "Function<String, Boolean>",
    "Predicate<String>",
    "Consumer<String>",
    "Supplier<Boolean>"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "Predicate<T> is designed specifically for testing conditions - it takes an argument of type T and returns a boolean. While Function<String, Boolean> would work, Predicate<String> is more idiomatic and provides additional methods like and(), or(), and negate().",
