  "question": "What is the key difference between stream.collect(Collectors.toList()) and stream.toList() in Java 16+?",
  "options": [
    "There is no difference, they are identical",
    "toList() returns an unmodifiable list, collect(toList()) returns a modifiable ArrayList",
    "collect(toList()) is faster",
    "toList() only works with String streams"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "The stream.toList() method introduced in Java 16 returns an unmodifiable list (you cannot add/remove elements). In contrast, Collectors.toList() returns a modifiable ArrayList. Choose based on whether you need to modify the result.",
