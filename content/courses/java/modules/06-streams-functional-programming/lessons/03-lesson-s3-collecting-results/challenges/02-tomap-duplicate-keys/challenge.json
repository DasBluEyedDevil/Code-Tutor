  "question": "What happens when you use Collectors.toMap() and the stream contains elements that map to the same key?",
  "options": [
    "The last value wins and overwrites previous values",
    "The first value wins and later values are ignored",
    "An IllegalStateException is thrown",
    "Both values are stored in a list"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "By default, Collectors.toMap() throws an IllegalStateException when it encounters duplicate keys. To handle duplicates, you must provide a merge function as the third argument, like (existing, newVal) -> existing to keep the first value.",
