HARDCODED (No Remote):
- Brightness welded to 100%
- Volume stuck at 50
- Want to change? Open TV, solder new circuits!

This is like hardcoding values in Java code.

- Brightness: adjustable 0-100%
- Volume: adjustable 0-100
- Language: English, Spanish, French...
- Change anytime WITHOUT opening the TV!

This is Spring Boot configuration:
- Values in application.properties or application.yml
- Change without recompiling code
- Different settings for different environments
