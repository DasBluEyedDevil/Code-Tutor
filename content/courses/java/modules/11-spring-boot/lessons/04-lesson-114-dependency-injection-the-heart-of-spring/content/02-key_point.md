WITHOUT DI (You Make Everything):
- Build your own stove
- Raise your own chickens
- Grow your own vegetables
- Make your own plates
- THEN cook dinner

This is like 'new UserService()' - you manage everything!

WITH DI (Restaurant Provides Everything):
- Professional stove (already installed)
- Fresh ingredients (delivered daily)
- Clean dishes (washed and ready)
- Trained staff

You just: COOK THE MEAL

Spring Container = Kitchen Manager:
1. Knows about all beans (objects it manages)
2. Creates them when needed
3. Injects them where required
4. Manages lifecycle (startup, shutdown)
