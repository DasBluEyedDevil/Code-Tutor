To build a web API manually, you need to:
- Set up a web server
- Configure routing (which URL goes where)
- Handle HTTP requests and responses
- Connect to a database
- Manage security
- Handle errors

This is HUNDREDS of lines of configuration code before you even start building features!

Spring Boot solves this: "Convention over Configuration"
- Auto-configures everything
- Provides sensible defaults
- You focus on business logic, not plumbing
