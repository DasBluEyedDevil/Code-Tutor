Building a web app from scratch:
= Chopping down trees and making furniture from raw wood
- Extremely difficult
- Takes forever
- Easy to mess up

Using Spring Boot:
= IKEA pre-packaged furniture
- All pieces provided
- Clear instructions
- Just assemble (write your business logic)

Spring Boot gives you the framework, you add your app's unique features.
