title: "Class vs Object - The Key Difference"
---

CLASS:
✓ A template/blueprint
✓ Defined once
✓ Describes structure and behavior
✓ Example: 'Student' class

OBJECT:
✓ An instance created from the class
✓ Created many times with 'new'
✓ Has actual data values
✓ Example: alice and bob are Student objects

Analogy:
Class = Cookie cutter
Object = Actual cookie

You use ONE cookie cutter to make MANY cookies.
