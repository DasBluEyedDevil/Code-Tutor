  "description": "Understanding layer caching for faster builds",
  "question": "You changed one line in your Java source code. With proper Dockerfile ordering, which layers need to rebuild?",
  "options": [
    "All layers - Docker rebuilds everything on any change",
    "Only the layers after COPY src/ and the final build step",
    "Only the base image layer",
    "No layers - Docker uses cached results for source changes"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "Docker caches layers and only rebuilds from the point where changes occur. With proper ordering (dependencies before source), changing source code only invalidates layers after COPY src/. The base image and dependency download layers remain cached, making rebuilds much faster.",
  "difficulty": "intermediate"
