Common mistake: 'We use Docker, so we're doing DevOps!'

DEVOPS IS NOT:
- Just using Docker
- Just having a CI/CD pipeline
- A job title (though 'DevOps Engineer' exists)
- A tool you can buy

DEVOPS IS:
- Shared responsibility between dev and ops
- Continuous improvement mindset
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Learning from failures (blameless postmortems)
- Measuring and improving metrics

KEY METRICS (DORA):
1. Deployment Frequency - How often do you deploy?
2. Lead Time - Code commit to production?
3. Mean Time to Recovery - How fast do you fix issues?
4. Change Failure Rate - What % of deployments cause problems?

ELITE PERFORMERS:
- Deploy multiple times per day
- Lead time under 1 hour
- Recover in under 1 hour
- Less than 15% change failure rate

You don't need to be elite on day one. Start small, automate incrementally, improve continuously.
