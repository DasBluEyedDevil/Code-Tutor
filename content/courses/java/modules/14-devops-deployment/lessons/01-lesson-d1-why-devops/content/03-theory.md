DevOps is a culture and set of practices that UNIFIES development and operations:

DEVOPS PRINCIPLES:

1. COLLABORATION
   - Developers and Ops work together
   - Shared responsibility for the entire lifecycle
   - No more 'throw it over the wall'

2. AUTOMATION
   - Automate testing, building, deploying
   - Reduce human error
   - Make deployments boring (in a good way)

3. CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION (CI)
   - Merge code frequently (multiple times/day)
   - Automatically test every change
   - Catch bugs early, when they're cheap to fix

4. CONTINUOUS DEPLOYMENT (CD)
   - Automatically deploy tested code
   - Small, frequent releases
   - Easy to rollback if issues arise

5. INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE
   - Define servers/config in version-controlled files
   - Reproducible environments
   - No more 'snowflake' servers

RESULTS:
- Deploy multiple times per day (not quarterly)
- Recover from failures in minutes (not hours)
- 99.9%+ uptime
- Happy developers AND happy ops
