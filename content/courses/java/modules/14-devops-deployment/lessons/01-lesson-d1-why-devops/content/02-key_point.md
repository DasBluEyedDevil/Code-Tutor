type: "KEY_POINT"
title: "Dev vs Ops: The Traditional Wall"
---

Historically, software companies had two separate teams:

DEVELOPMENT TEAM:
- Writes code
- Tests on local machines
- Throws code 'over the wall'
- Success = features work in development

OPERATIONS TEAM:
- Receives code to deploy
- Manages servers and infrastructure
- Fights fires when things break
- Success = systems stay running

THE PROBLEM:
- Devs optimize for speed of development
- Ops optimizes for stability
- Different goals = conflict
- No one 'owns' the whole process

When things break:
- Devs: 'It worked in development!'
- Ops: 'You didn't test it properly!'
- Both are right. Both are wrong.

The 'wall' between teams creates:
- Slow deployments (weeks, not hours)
- Blame games when issues arise
- Lack of shared responsibility
- Technical debt accumulation
