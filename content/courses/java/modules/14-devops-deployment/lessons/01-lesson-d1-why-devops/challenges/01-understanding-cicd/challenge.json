  "question": "What is the PRIMARY benefit of Continuous Integration (CI)?",
  "options": [
    "It eliminates the need for testing",
    "It catches bugs early by testing every code change automatically",
    "It makes deployments faster by skipping the build step",
    "It replaces the need for version control"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "Continuous Integration automatically tests every code change as soon as it's pushed. This catches bugs early, when they're easier and cheaper to fix. The earlier you catch a bug, the less context-switching required to fix it. CI doesn't skip steps - it automates them.",
