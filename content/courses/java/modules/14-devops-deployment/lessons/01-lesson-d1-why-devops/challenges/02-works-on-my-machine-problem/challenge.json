  "question": "Your Spring Boot app works locally but crashes in production with 'NoSuchMethodError'. What's the MOST LIKELY cause?",
  "options": [
    "The production server is too slow",
    "Different Java version or dependency versions between environments",
    "The database password is wrong",
    "The network connection is unstable"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "NoSuchMethodError typically means a method existed at compile time but not at runtime - usually caused by version mismatches. Different Java versions or dependency versions between development and production are a classic 'works on my machine' problem. Docker solves this by packaging the exact environment with your application.",
