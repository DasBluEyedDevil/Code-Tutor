  "question": "How does Spring Boot read the environment variable DATABASE_URL?",
  "options": [
    "You must explicitly call System.getenv(\"DATABASE_URL\") in your code",
    "Spring Boot automatically maps it to spring.datasource.url",
    "You must define it in application.properties first",
    "Railway automatically injects it into application.properties file"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "Spring Boot has built-in support for environment variables. DATABASE_URL is a special case that Spring Boot's DataSource auto-configuration recognizes and uses for the database connection. For custom variables, Spring Boot converts them: MY_CUSTOM_VAR becomes my.custom.var in properties.",
