  "question": "Given this trigger configuration, when does the workflow run?\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [main]",
  "options": [
    "Only when pushing directly to main",
    "Only when a pull request targets main",
    "When pushing to main OR when a PR targets main",
    "On every push and every pull request to any branch"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The 'on' section defines trigger events. Multiple events are OR-ed together. This workflow runs when: (1) Code is pushed directly to main, OR (2) A pull request is opened/updated that targets main. It does NOT run for pushes to other branches or PRs targeting other branches.",
