  "question": "You run 'docker compose down' and then 'docker compose up'. What happens to your PostgreSQL data?",
  "options": [
    "Data is always lost - containers are ephemeral",
    "Data is preserved if you used a named volume, lost if you didn't",
    "Data is automatically backed up to Docker Hub",
    "Data is preserved in the container's filesystem"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "Named volumes (postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data) persist data outside the container lifecycle. 'docker compose down' removes containers but not named volumes. 'docker compose down -v' removes volumes too. Without volumes, container data is lost when the container is removed.",
