  "description": "Understanding why CORS exists",
  "question": "Why does the browser block requests from localhost:5173 to localhost:8080 by default?",
  "options": [
    "The ports are different so the connection fails",
    "Spring Boot rejects requests from unknown sources",
    "CORS security policy prevents cross-origin requests to protect users",
    "React cannot make HTTP requests without special configuration"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature that prevents JavaScript from making requests to different origins (different domain, port, or protocol). This protects users from malicious sites making unauthorized requests to other services. The server must explicitly allow cross-origin requests by sending appropriate CORS headers.",
