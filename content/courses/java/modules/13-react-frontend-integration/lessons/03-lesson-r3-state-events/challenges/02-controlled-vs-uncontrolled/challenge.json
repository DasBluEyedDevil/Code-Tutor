  "question": "What makes this input 'controlled'?\n<input value={email} onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)} />",
  "options": [
    "The input has both value and onChange props",
    "React controls the input's value through state - the value prop always reflects state",
    "The onChange handler is an arrow function",
    "The input is inside a form element"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "A controlled input has its value controlled by React state. The value prop displays the current state, and onChange updates the state. React is the 'single source of truth' - the DOM input's value always matches React's state. This allows React to validate, transform, or reject input changes.",
