  "question": "What's wrong with this code?\nconst [user, setUser] = useState({ name: 'Alice', age: 25 });\nuser.age = 26;\nsetUser(user);",
  "options": [
    "Nothing - this correctly updates the age",
    "setUser should be called with user.age instead",
    "Mutating state directly won't trigger re-render; should spread: setUser({...user, age: 26})",
    "useState can't hold objects, only primitives"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "This mutates the existing object then passes the same reference to setUser. React compares references for objects - since the reference is the same, React thinks nothing changed and won't re-render. Always create new objects/arrays: setUser({...user, age: 26}) creates a new object with the updated value.",
