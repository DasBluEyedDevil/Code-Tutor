  "question": "Your React app at localhost:5173 gets a CORS error when calling your Spring Boot API. What's the MOST LIKELY cause?",
  "options": [
    "React doesn't support cross-origin requests",
    "Spring Boot's CorsConfig doesn't include 'http://localhost:5173' in allowedOrigins",
    "The fetch call is missing the 'cors' mode option",
    "You need to use axios instead of fetch for CORS to work"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "CORS errors occur when the server doesn't explicitly allow the client's origin. Spring Boot must have CorsConfig (or @CrossOrigin) that includes 'http://localhost:5173' in allowedOrigins. The browser blocks requests that don't have proper CORS headers in the response. React/fetch/axios all support CORS - it's a server configuration issue.",
