  "question": "What's the difference between useEffect(() => {...}, []) and useEffect(() => {...}, [userId])?",
  "options": [
    "No difference - both run once on mount",
    "[] runs once on mount; [userId] runs on mount AND whenever userId changes",
    "[userId] only runs when userId changes, not on mount",
    "[] is for GET requests, [userId] is for POST requests"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "Empty array [] means the effect runs once when the component mounts. [userId] means the effect runs on mount AND re-runs whenever userId changes. This is how you fetch data that depends on a parameter - when the parameter changes, you refetch.",
