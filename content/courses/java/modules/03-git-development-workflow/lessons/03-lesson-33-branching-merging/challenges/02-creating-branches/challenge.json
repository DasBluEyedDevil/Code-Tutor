  "question": "Which command creates a new branch named 'feature/login' AND switches to it in one step?",
  "options": [
    "git branch feature/login",
    "git checkout feature/login",
    "git switch -c feature/login",
    "git merge feature/login"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 2,
  "explanation": "The 'git switch -c feature/login' command (or 'git checkout -b feature/login') creates a new branch AND switches to it in one step. Just 'git branch' only creates the branch without switching. Just 'git checkout' without -b switches to an existing branch.",
