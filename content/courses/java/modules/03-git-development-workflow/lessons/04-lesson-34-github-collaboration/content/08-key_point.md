CODE REVIEW is one of the most valuable practices in software development.

AS A REVIEWER:

1. Be constructive and respectful:
   ✓ 'Consider using a constant here for readability'
   ✗ 'This is wrong'

2. Ask questions instead of demanding:
   ✓ 'What happens if userId is null?'
   ✗ 'You forgot null check'

3. Praise good code:
   ✓ 'Nice use of the builder pattern here!'
   People learn from positive feedback too.

4. Focus on:
   - Logic errors and bugs
   - Code clarity and maintainability
   - Missing edge cases
   - Security issues
   - Performance concerns

5. Approve when requirements are met:
   Don't block for minor style preferences.


AS A PR AUTHOR:

1. Don't take feedback personally
   Reviewers are improving the code, not criticizing you.

2. Respond to all comments
   Either make the change or explain why not.

3. Say thank you
   Reviewing takes time and mental energy.

4. Learn from feedback
   Use reviews to grow as a developer.
