title: "Remote Repositories: Beyond Your Computer"
---

So far, all your Git work has been LOCAL - on your own computer. But what if:
- Your computer crashes and you lose everything?
- You want to work from a different machine?
- You need to collaborate with teammates?

This is where REMOTE REPOSITORIES come in.

A REMOTE is a copy of your repository stored somewhere else, usually on a server like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

KEY CONCEPTS:

1. ORIGIN: The default name for your main remote repository
   When you clone a repo, Git automatically names that remote 'origin'

2. PUSH: Upload your local commits to the remote
   Your work becomes visible to others and is backed up

3. PULL: Download changes from the remote to your local repo
   Get your teammates' work onto your machine

4. CLONE: Create a local copy of a remote repository
   Start working on an existing project

5. FORK: Create your own remote copy of someone else's repository
   Used for contributing to open source projects
