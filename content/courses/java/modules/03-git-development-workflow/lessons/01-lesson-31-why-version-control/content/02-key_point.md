Git is a VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM - software that tracks changes to your code over time.

Think of Git as a time machine for your project:

✓ SAVE CHECKPOINTS: At any point, you can save a 'snapshot' of your entire project
✓ TIME TRAVEL: You can go back to any previous snapshot instantly
✓ SEE WHAT CHANGED: Compare any two points in time to see exactly what was modified
✓ PARALLEL UNIVERSES: Work on experimental features without affecting your main code
✓ COLLABORATION: Multiple developers can work on the same project without chaos

Git was created by Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux) in 2005. Today, it's used by:
- 100+ million developers worldwide
- Every major tech company (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Netflix...)
- Open source projects of all sizes
- Solo developers managing personal projects

In 2025, knowing Git is not optional - it's expected. According to industry surveys, over 95% of developers use Git daily.
