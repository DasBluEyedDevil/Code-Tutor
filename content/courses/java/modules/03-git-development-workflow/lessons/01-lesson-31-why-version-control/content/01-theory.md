Imagine you're working on a Java project. You've spent hours building a feature, and it works perfectly. Then you decide to 'improve' it:

1. You delete some code that seems unnecessary
2. You refactor a method to be 'cleaner'
3. You realize your changes broke everything
4. You frantically try to remember what you deleted
5. You can't. Hours of work - gone.

Or imagine this scenario:
- Monday: Your code works perfectly
- Tuesday: You add a new feature
- Wednesday: You find a bug - but where did it come from?
- You have no way to see what changed between Monday and Wednesday

Without version control, you're:
❌ Working without a safety net
❌ Unable to track when bugs were introduced
❌ Risking losing hours or days of work
❌ Unable to collaborate effectively with others
❌ Creating chaos with files like 'project_final_v2_REAL_final.zip'

This is why every professional developer uses version control.
