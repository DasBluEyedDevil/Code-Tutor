Many beginners confuse Git and GitHub. They're related but different:

GIT:
- Software that runs on your computer
- Tracks changes locally on your machine
- Works completely offline
- Free and open source
- Created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds

GITHUB:
- A website/cloud service (github.com)
- Hosts Git repositories online
- Enables collaboration with other developers
- Adds features: issues, pull requests, code review
- Owned by Microsoft since 2018

Analogy:
Git = The engine of a car (does the actual work)
GitHub = A parking garage (a place to store your car and meet others)

You can use Git without GitHub (local-only version control).
You cannot use GitHub without Git (GitHub stores Git repositories).

Other Git hosting services exist: GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps.
They all use Git - they're just different 'parking garages'.
