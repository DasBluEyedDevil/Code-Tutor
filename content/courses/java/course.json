SESSION-BASED (Simpler, for beginners)\n   - Login creates session\n   - Session stored on server\n   - Good for traditional web apps\n\n2. TOKEN-BASED (JWT)\n   - Login returns JWT token\n   - Client sends token with each request\n   - Stateless, good for APIs\n\nLEARNING PATH:\nThis lesson: HTTP Basic Auth (simple, for testing)\nLater lessons: JWT tokens (production-ready)\n\nNOTE: Basic Auth is NOT recommended for production.\nWe use it here to understand Spring Security fundamentals.\nYou'll learn JWT (the production standard) in upcoming lessons!"
