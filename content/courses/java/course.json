DEVELOPMENT (Your laptop):\\n +\n                   - Run: ./mvnw spring-boot:run\\n +\n                   - Database: localhost:5432\\n +\n                   - Hot reload enabled\\n +\n                   - Debug mode on\\n\\n +\n                2. BUILD (Create executable):\\n +\n                   - Package as JAR file\\n +\n                   - All dependencies included\\n +\n                   - Single file to deploy\\n\\n +\n                3. TEST ENVIRONMENT (Pre-production):\\n +\n                   - Test database\\n +\n                   - Similar to production\\n +\n                   - Catch bugs before users see them\\n\\n +\n                4. PRODUCTION (The real thing):\\n +\n                   - Real database with real data\\n +\n                   - Real users\\n +\n                   - Must be reliable, secure, fast\\n +\n
