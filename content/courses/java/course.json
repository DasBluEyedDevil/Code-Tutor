You leave the kitchen for 5 minutes and return to find:\n\n- The peanut butter jar is unopened\n- They spread jelly on the outside of the bread\n- The knife is on the floor\n- They're confused why it didn't work\n\n**What went wrong?**\n\nYou assumed they knew things: \"spread\" means using a knife, \"on the bread\" means the inside face, you need to open jars first. But your sibling followed your words **exactly** as you said them—no more, no less.\n\n**This is how computers work.**\n\nA computer is the most obedient, most literal \"sibling\" imaginable. It will do **exactly** what you tell it—nothing more, nothing less. It has zero common sense. It can't guess what you meant. It can't improvise.\n\n**The problem**: How do we give instructions to something that has no intuition, no context, and no ability to \"figure it out\"?\n\n**The solution**: We write a **program**—a hyper-detailed, step-by-step recipe that leaves nothing to chance.\n\n---\n\n## PART 2: The \"Bridge\" (The Analogy)\n\n### Programming is Recipe Writing (But More Precise)\n\nLet's compare a recipe for humans vs. a recipe for a computer:\n\n#### Recipe for a Human:\n```\n1. Preheat oven to 350°F\n2. Mix the ingredients\n3. Bake for 20 minutes\n```\n\n**Why this works**: Humans know what \"mix\" means. They know ovens have dials. They know \"ingredients\" refers to the list above.\n\n#### Recipe for a Computer:\n```\n1. LOCATE the oven dial (object: oven, property: temperature_dial)\n2. TURN the dial clockwise until the display shows 350\n3. WAIT until the light labeled \"READY\" turns green\n4. OPEN the ingredient_box\n5. FOR EACH item in ingredient_box:\n   5a. MEASURE the item using the measuring_cup\n   5b. POUR into the bowl labeled \"mixing_bowl\"\n6. PICK UP the spoon labeled \"mixing_spoon\"\n7. MOVE spoon in circular motion inside mixing_bowl for 60 seconds\n8. PLACE mixing_bowl into oven\n9. START timer for 20 minutes\n10. WAIT until timer beeps\n11. REMOVE mixing_bowl from oven\n```\n\n**Notice the difference?**\n\n- Every action is explicit (\"TURN,\" \"POUR,\" \"MOVE\")\n- Every object is identified (\"the oven dial,\" \"the mixing_bowl\")\n- No assumptions are made (\"Wait until the light turns green,\" not \"when it's ready\")\n\n**This is programming.** You're writing a recipe so detailed that something with **zero intelligence** can follow it perfectly.\n\n---\n\n## PART 3: The \"How\" (The Concept)\n\n### What is a Computer Program, Really?\n\nA **computer program** is:\n\n1. **A sequence of instructions** (step 1, step 2, step 3...)\n2. **Written in a language the computer understands** (like Java, Python, or C++)\n3. **That manipulates data** (numbers, text, images, etc.)\n4. **To produce a result** (a calculation, a webpage, a video game)\n\n### Breaking It Down\n\n#### 1. Instructions\nComputers execute instructions **one at a time**, in order (usually). Examples:\n- \"Store the number 5 in a box\"\n- \"Add 3 to whatever is in the box\"\n- \"Show the result on the screen\"\n\n#### 2. Language\nComputers don't understand English. They understand **machine code** (0s and 1s). But writing in 0s and 1s is torture, so we use **programming languages** like Java, which look more like English. Java gets translated into machine code automatically.\n\n#### 3. Data\nPrograms work with information:\n- Numbers (your bank balance, your age, the score in a game)\n- Text (your name, a tweet, a search query)\n- Images, videos, sounds (all secretly just numbers to a computer)\n\n#### 4. Results\nEvery program has a purpose:\n- A calculator program takes numbers and outputs an answer\n- A game program takes your button presses and outputs visuals/sounds\n- A web server program takes requests and outputs webpages\n\n### Key Insight: Computers Are Dumb (And That's Okay)\n\nComputers can't:\n- ❌ Guess what you meant\n- ❌ Improvise or adapt\n- ❌ Understand context\n- ❌ Learn without being programmed to learn\n\nBut computers **can**:\n- ✅ Follow instructions perfectly, billions of times per second\n- ✅ Remember massive amounts of data flawlessly\n- ✅ Repeat tasks without getting tired or bored\n- ✅ Do exactly what you tell them, every single time\n\n**Your job as a programmer**: Be the smart one. Give the instructions. The computer will be the obedient one.\n\n---\n\n## PART 4: The \"Do\" (Interactive Challenge)\n\nNow it's your turn. I want to see if you understand what makes a good \"computer instruction.\"\n\n### Challenge: The Sandwich Test\n\nImagine you're programming a robot to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The robot has:\n- Two arms with grippers\n- The ability to see objects on the table\n- No common sense whatsoever\n\nOn the table:\n- A loaf of bread (closed bag)\n- A jar of peanut butter (closed, with lid)\n- A jar of jelly (closed, with lid)\n- A butter knife\n- A plate\n\n**Your Task**: Write step-by-step instructions (in plain English) to make the robot successfully create a PB&J sandwich. Be **ridiculously specific**. Remember: the robot will do **exactly** what you write, nothing more.\n\n**Rules**:\n1. Write at least 15 steps (you'll need them!)\n2. Assume the robot starts with its arms at its sides\n3. Don't skip \"obvious\" steps (opening jars, putting slices together, etc.)\n\n### Where to Submit\n\nCreate a text file in the `student-work/epoch-0/` folder called `lesson-0.1-sandwich-robot.txt` and write your instructions there.\n\n**Hint**: Think about:\n- How does the robot know which object is which?\n- What does \"spread\" actually mean in physical terms?\n- What order should things happen in?\n\n---\n\n## PART 5: The \"Review\" (Feedback Loop)\n\nOnce you've written your instructions, come back here and tell me:\n\n**\"I've completed the Sandwich Robot challenge!\"**\n\nI will then:\n1. Review your instructions\n2. Point out any steps where the robot would get confused\n3. Explain what might go wrong\n4. Help you refine your thinking\n\n**Why This Matters**: This exercise reveals exactly how you need to think when programming. If you can write clear robot instructions, you can write clear code.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Lesson Summary\n\nBefore you move to Lesson 0.2, make sure you can answer these:\n\n1. **What is a computer program?**\n   - A detailed, step-by-step set of instructions for a computer\n\n2. **Why can't we just tell computers what to do in normal English?**\n   - Because computers are literal and have no common sense—they need explicit, precise instructions\n\n3. **What's the key difference between a human recipe and a computer recipe?**\n   - Computer recipes must be ridiculously specific, with zero assumptions\n\n4. **What does a programmer's job really involve?**\n   - Thinking through problems in extreme detail and translating solutions into computer instructions\n\n---\n\n## Next Lesson\n\nOnce you've completed the Sandwich Robot challenge, you'll move to:\n\n**[Lesson 0.2: Why Java?](./Lesson-0.2-Why-Java.md)** (Coming after you complete this lesson)\n\nWhere you'll learn why we're using Java specifically for this journey.\n\n---\n\n**Ready to program a sandwich?** Create your `lesson-0.1-sandwich-robot.txt` file and show me what you've got!\n"
