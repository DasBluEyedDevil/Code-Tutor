title: "Why Django? - Key Takeaways"

**When to Use Django:**

- **Admin interface needed:** Auto-generated CRUD for content management
- **Full web application:** Templates, forms, authentication built-in
- **Rapid development:** Get from idea to working app quickly
- **Team projects:** Strong conventions mean consistent code
- **Relational databases:** Django ORM is excellent

**When to Use FastAPI Instead:**

- **Pure APIs:** No templates or admin needed
- **Async required:** WebSockets, real-time features
- **Microservices:** Lightweight, containerized services
- **Maximum performance:** FastAPI is faster for API workloads

**Key Django Features:**

1. **Batteries-included** - Everything you need out of the box
2. **Admin panel** - Production-ready CRUD interface automatically
3. **ORM** - Database operations without SQL
4. **Security** - CSRF, XSS, SQL injection protection by default
5. **Scalable** - Powers Instagram, Pinterest, Spotify

**Bottom Line:**

- Building a website with admin? **Django**
- Building an API for a mobile app? **FastAPI**
- Building both? Use both! They work great together.
