  "title": "Django vs FastAPI Decision Making",
  "description": "Test your understanding of when to choose Django vs FastAPI.",
  "question": "You're building a content management system (CMS) where editors need to create, edit, and delete articles through a web interface. The site will also have a public-facing blog. Which framework is the better choice and why?",
  "options": [
    "FastAPI - because it has better documentation",
    "Django - because it has a built-in admin panel and template engine",
    "FastAPI - because it's async and faster",
    "Django - because it's older and more stable"
  ],
  "correctAnswer": 1,
  "explanation": "Django is the clear winner for CMS projects. Its auto-generated admin panel gives editors a ready-to-use interface for managing content without writing custom code. The built-in template engine handles the public blog pages. While FastAPI is faster for pure APIs, you'd have to build the entire admin interface and templating from scratch.",
  "difficulty": "advanced"
