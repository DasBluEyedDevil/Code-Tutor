- **Test your APIs** before deployment - catch bugs early with pytest
- **Use pytest fixtures** to create reusable test setup (test client, database)
- **Test all scenarios**: success cases, error cases, edge cases, validation
- **Check status codes** (200, 201, 400, 404) and response structure
- **Document with OpenAPI/Swagger** - industry standard for API docs
- **Flasgger** adds Swagger UI to Flask with minimal setup
- **Interactive docs** let users try your API without writing code
- **Keep documentation in sync** - outdated docs are worse than no docs
- **Run tests in CI/CD** - automated testing on every commit prevents regressions
