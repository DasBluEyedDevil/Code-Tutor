**Django's Journey to Async**

Django has progressively added async support across multiple versions:

**Django 3.0 (2019)** - ASGI Support
- Django could run under ASGI servers (uvicorn, daphne)
- No async views yet, just the foundation

**Django 3.1 (2020)** - Async Views & Middleware
- First async view support
- Async middleware possible
- sync_to_async and async_to_sync utilities

**Django 4.1 (2022)** - Async ORM Foundations
- Async-compatible QuerySet interface
- Still executed synchronously under the hood

**Django 4.2 (2023)** - More Async ORM
- aget_or_create, aupdate_or_create
- Better async support in many areas

**Django 5.0-5.2 (2024-2025)** - Full Async ORM
- True async database queries with aall(), afirst(), acount()
- Async authentication: aauthenticate(), alogin(), alogout()
- Async context processors
- Async signals (partial)

**Why Async Matters:**

```python
# Sync: Waits for each external call
def sync_view(request):
    data1 = fetch_api_1()  # Blocks 100ms
    data2 = fetch_api_2()  # Blocks 100ms
    return JsonResponse(...)  # Total: 200ms

# Async: Concurrent external calls
async def async_view(request):
    data1, data2 = await asyncio.gather(
        fetch_api_1(),  # Runs concurrently
        fetch_api_2()   # Runs concurrently
    )
    return JsonResponse(...)  # Total: ~100ms
```

**When to Use Async Views:**
- Multiple external API calls
- WebSocket connections
- Long-polling endpoints
- I/O-heavy operations (file uploads, external services)
