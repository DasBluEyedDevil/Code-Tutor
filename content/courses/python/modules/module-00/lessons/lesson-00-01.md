# What is Programming?

Welcome to your journey into programming! You're about to learn one of the most valuable skills in the modern world.

## Programming is Like Giving Instructions

Think about giving directions to a friend:
- "Go straight for 2 blocks"
- "Turn left at the traffic light"
- "The house is on your right"

Programming is similar! You're giving instructions to a computer. The difference is that computers are very literal - they do exactly what you tell them, nothing more, nothing less.

## Why Python?

Python is one of the best languages to start with because:

1. **It reads like English** - You can often guess what code does just by reading it
2. **It's forgiving** - Python is designed to be beginner-friendly
3. **It's powerful** - From websites to AI, Python can do it all
4. **It's popular** - Millions of developers use Python daily

## Your First Program

The traditional first program in any language is "Hello, World!" - a simple program that displays text on the screen.

In Python, it's incredibly simple:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

That's it! One line of code that tells the computer to display "Hello, World!" on the screen.

## What Does It Do?

- `print()` is a **function** - a command that tells Python to do something
- The text inside the parentheses and quotes is what will be displayed
- Functions are like verbs in English - they represent actions

## Key Concepts

**Programming**: Writing instructions for a computer to follow

**Code**: The instructions you write in a programming language

**Function**: A reusable piece of code that performs a specific task

**Print**: A function that displays text on the screen

## Let's Get Started!

In the next exercise, you'll write your own Python code for the first time. Don't worry about making mistakes - that's how we all learn!

Remember: Every expert programmer started exactly where you are right now.
