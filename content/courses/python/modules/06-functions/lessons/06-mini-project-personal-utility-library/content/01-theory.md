Every programmer eventually builds their own **utility library** - a collection of helpful functions they use over and over again. It's like a chef's personal recipe book, filled with go-to techniques they've perfected over time.

**What makes a good utility function?**

1. **Does ONE thing well** - Single responsibility
2. **Has a clear name** - You should know what it does just by reading the name
3. **Works in many situations** - Generic enough to reuse
4. **Has sensible defaults** - Easy to use in common cases
5. **Handles edge cases** - What if the input is empty? Zero? Negative?

**Common categories of utility functions:**

- **String utilities**: Format text, validate input, clean data
- **Math utilities**: Calculations, conversions, rounding
- **Date/time utilities**: Format dates, calculate ages, time differences
- **Validation utilities**: Check if data is valid (email, phone, etc.)
- **Formatting utilities**: Convert data for display

In this mini-project, you'll build your own utility library with functions you can actually use in future projects!
