- **Utility functions** are reusable helpers that solve common problems
- **Good functions do ONE thing** - Single responsibility principle
- **Use clear, descriptive names** - `calculate_percentage` not `calc` or `cp`
- **Add docstrings** - Brief explanation of what the function does
- **Handle edge cases** - Empty lists, zero values, invalid input
- **Use default parameters** - Make common use cases easy
- **Return values, don't print** - Let the caller decide what to do with results
- **Test your functions** - Try different inputs, including edge cases
- **Build your library over time** - Add functions as you need them
- **Organize by category** - String utils, math utils, formatting utils, etc.
