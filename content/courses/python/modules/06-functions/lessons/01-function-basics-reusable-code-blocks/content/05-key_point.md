- **Functions are reusable code blocks** - Write once, use many times
- **`def` keyword** creates a function: `def function_name():`
- **Function names** should be lowercase with underscores: `calculate_total`, `send_email`
- **Indentation matters** - All code inside a function must be indented
- **Defining vs. calling**: `def greet():` creates the function, `greet()` runs it
- **Functions help organize code** - Break big problems into small, manageable pieces
- **Order matters**: Define a function BEFORE you call it
- **You can call functions multiple times** - That's the whole point!
- **Functions can call other functions** - Build complex behavior from simple pieces
