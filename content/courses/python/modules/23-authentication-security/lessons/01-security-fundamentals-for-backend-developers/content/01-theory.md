Every security decision you make should be guided by three core principles known as the **CIA Triad**:

**Confidentiality** - Only authorized users can access sensitive data
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Access controls and authentication
- Data classification (public, private, secret)

**Integrity** - Data cannot be modified without detection
- Checksums and hashes
- Digital signatures
- Audit trails

**Availability** - Systems remain accessible when needed
- Redundancy and failover
- DDoS protection
- Backup and recovery

**In our Finance Tracker:**
- **Confidentiality**: User passwords and account balances must be protected
- **Integrity**: Transaction amounts must not be tampered with
- **Availability**: Users should always be able to access their financial data
