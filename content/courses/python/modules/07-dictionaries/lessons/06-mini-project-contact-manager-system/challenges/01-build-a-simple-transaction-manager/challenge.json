Implement `add_transaction(transactions, id, category, amount, tags)` that adds a transaction with the given details. Tags should be stored as a set.\n3. Implement `get_transaction(transactions, id)` that safely returns a transaction or None\n4. Implement `get_all_tags(transactions)` that returns all unique tags across all transactions\n5. Add at least 3 sample transactions and test your functions\n6. Print a summary showing all transactions and unique tags",
