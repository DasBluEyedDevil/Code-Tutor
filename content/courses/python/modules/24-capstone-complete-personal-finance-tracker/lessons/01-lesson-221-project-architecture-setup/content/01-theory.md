**Welcome to the Capstone Project!**

Over the next 6 lessons, you'll build a complete Personal Finance Tracker from scratch. This isn't a tutorial where you copy code—you'll make architectural decisions, write tests first, and build a production-ready application.

**What You'll Build:**
- REST API with FastAPI for managing transactions, categories, and budgets
- PostgreSQL database with asyncpg for async operations
- JWT authentication with secure password hashing
- Comprehensive test suite with pytest
- Type-safe code with full type hints
- Modern Python patterns (dataclasses, pathlib, match/case)

**Prerequisites:**
You should have completed Modules 1-21. This capstone integrates:
- Module 1-5: Python fundamentals
- Module 6: Functions and pathlib
- Module 11-12: OOP and decorators
- Module 14: Type hints
- Module 15: Asyncio
- Module 16: CLI with Typer
- Module 17: Exception handling
- Module 18-19: Testing
- Module 20: PostgreSQL with asyncpg
- Module 21: Authentication & Security
