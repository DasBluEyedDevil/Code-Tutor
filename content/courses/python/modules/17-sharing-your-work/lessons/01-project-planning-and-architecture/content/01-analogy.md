**Project architecture = Blueprint for your code**

**Think of building a house:**

**Without planning:**
- Start building walls randomly
- Forget about plumbing
- Add rooms wherever
- Result: Unusable mess

**With planning:**
- Draw blueprints first
- Plan room layout
- Consider utilities (water, electricity)
- Result: Livable, maintainable home

**Software is the same!**

**Good project planning includes:**

1. **Requirements** 📋
   - What should the project do?
   - Who will use it?
   - What problems does it solve?

2. **Architecture** 🏗️
   - How will components interact?
   - What's the folder structure?
   - What technologies to use?

3. **Design patterns** 🎨
   - Common solutions to common problems
   - MVC, Repository, Factory, etc.
   - Proven approaches

4. **Data flow** 🔄
   - How does data move through the system?
   - Where is data stored?
   - What transforms the data?

**Key principle:**
"Hours of planning save weeks of coding"
