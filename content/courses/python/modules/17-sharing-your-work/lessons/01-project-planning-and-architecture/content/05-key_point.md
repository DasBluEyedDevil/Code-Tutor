- **Plan before coding** - Hours of planning save weeks of debugging
- **Layered architecture** - Models → Repositories → Services → API
- **Separation of concerns** - Each layer has one responsibility
- **Repository pattern** - Isolate data access from business logic
- **Service layer** - Centralize validation and business rules
- **Configuration management** - Use .env files, never commit secrets
- **Project structure** - Organize code logically (src/, tests/, docs/)
- **Design principles** - DRY, SOLID, loose coupling, high cohesion
