- **if statements** make code conditional - it only runs when the condition is True
- **Syntax**: `if condition:` (keyword, condition, colon, indentation)
- **Indentation is MANDATORY** in Python - use 4 spaces consistently
- **The colon (:)** after the condition is required - don't forget it!
- **Code flow**: Python evaluates the condition, runs indented code if True, skips it if False
- **Multiple if statements** are independent - each check runs separately
- **Common mistakes**:
<li>Missing colon
- Wrong indentation (too much, too little, mixing tabs/spaces)
- Using `=` instead of `==`
- Indenting code that should always run

</li>- **if works with any Boolean**: comparisons, logical operators, Boolean variables

### Before Moving On:
Make sure you can:

- Write a basic if statement with proper syntax
- Indent code correctly (4 spaces)
- Explain what happens when condition is True vs False
- Debug common indentation and syntax errors

### Coming Up Next:
In **Lesson 4: if-else Statements**, you'll learn to handle BOTH paths:

- "IF condition is True, do this; ELSE do that"
- Guaranteeing one of two paths always executes
- Building programs that handle all scenarios

Right now, your if statements only do something when True. With if-else, you'll handle BOTH True AND False cases explicitly!
