Imagine you're at a door with an electronic lock. The lock doesn't care about your story, your excuses, or your good intentions. It asks one simple question:

<p style='text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;'>"Is the code correct?"</p>The answer can only be:

- **YES** → The door unlocks
- **NO** → The door stays locked

There's no "maybe," no "almost," no "it depends." Just YES or NO. TRUE or FALSE.

This is **Boolean logic** - named after mathematician George Boole, who realized that all logical reasoning boils down to true/false questions.

### Real-World Examples of Boolean Thinking:

- **Traffic light**: "Is the light green?" → True = Go, False = Stop
- **Email login**: "Is the password correct?" → True = Log in, False = Show error
- **Shopping cart**: "Is the total over $50?" → True = Free shipping, False = Pay shipping
- **Age verification**: "Is age >= 18?" → True = Allow, False = Deny

Every decision a computer makes starts with these yes/no questions. In Python, we call these questions **Boolean expressions**, and the answers are **Boolean values**: `True` or `False`.

### The Foundation of All Programming Decisions:
Remember the calculator from Module 2? When we checked `if choice == 1:`, we were asking a Boolean question:

<pre>"Is the user's choice equal to 1?"</pre>The answer (True or False) determined which path the program took. Now you'll learn how to ask these questions deliberately and powerfully!
