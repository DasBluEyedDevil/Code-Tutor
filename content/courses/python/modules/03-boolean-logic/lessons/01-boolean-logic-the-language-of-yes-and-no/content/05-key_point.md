- **Boolean values** are `True` or `False` (capitalized!) - the foundation of all program decisions
- **Comparison operators** ask questions and return Boolean values:
<li>`==` equal, `!=` not equal
- `&gt;` greater, `&lt;` less
- `&gt;=` greater or equal, `&lt;=` less or equal

</li>- **Don't confuse:**
<li>`=` (assignment: "make it equal")
- `==` (comparison: "check if equal")

</li>- **Store Boolean results** in variables with descriptive names for readable code
- **String comparisons** are case-sensitive: "Hello" ≠ "hello"
- **The data type** is called `bool` (check with `type()`)
- **Mathematical truth:** `True == 1` and `False == 0` (useful for counting!)

### Before Moving On:
Make sure you can:

- Write comparisons using all six operators
- Explain the difference between `=` and `==`
- Store Boolean results in variables
- Predict what a comparison will return (True or False)

### Coming Up Next:
In **Lesson 2: Logical Operators**, you'll learn how to combine multiple Boolean questions:

- `and` - "Is this true AND that true?"
- `or` - "Is this true OR that true?"
- `not` - "Is this NOT true?"

This lets you ask complex questions like: "Is the user an adult AND has a valid ID?" or "Is it the weekend OR a holiday?"
