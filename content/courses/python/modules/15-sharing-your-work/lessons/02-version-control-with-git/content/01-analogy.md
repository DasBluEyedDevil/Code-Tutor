**Git = Save points for your code**

**Think of a video game:**
- Save your progress before boss fight
- Try different strategies
- Go back if you fail
- Keep multiple save files

**Git does this for code!**

**Key concepts:**

1. **Repository (repo)** 📁
   - Project folder with Git tracking
   - Contains all history
   - Local (your computer) + Remote (GitHub)

2. **Commit** 💾
   - Save point in history
   - Snapshot of all files
   - Has message describing changes
   - Permanent record

3. **Branch** 🌳
   - Parallel version of code
   - Experiment without breaking main code
   - Merge back when ready
   - main/master = production code

4. **Merge** 🔀
   - Combine branches
   - Integrate features
   - May have conflicts to resolve

5. **Pull Request (PR)** 🤝
   - Request to merge your changes
   - Code review
   - Discussion before merging
   - Quality control

**Basic workflow:**
```
1. Clone repo (copy to your computer)
2. Create branch (new feature)
3. Make changes
4. Commit changes (save point)
5. Push to GitHub (backup)
6. Create Pull Request
7. Review + Merge
```

**Why use Git:**
- Track every change ever made
- Collaborate without overwriting others
- Experiment safely
- Revert mistakes
- Required for professional development
