- **Packages = directories with __init__.py** - Organize related modules together
- **__init__.py controls package interface** - Use __all__ to define public API
- **Modules are reusable** - Write once, import anywhere in your package
- **if __name__ == '__main__':' is essential** - Test modules independently
- **requirements.txt manages dependencies** - Document what packages your project needs
- **Virtual environments isolate projects** - Each project gets its own package versions
- **Proper structure scales** - Start organized, stay organized as project grows
- **Import from packages with dot notation** - from .module import function for relative imports
