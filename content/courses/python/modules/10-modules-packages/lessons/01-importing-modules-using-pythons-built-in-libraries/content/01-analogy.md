**Modules = Pre-written code you can use**

Imagine building a house. You don't make your own nails, hammer, or saw - you use tools others have already made. Python modules are like that toolbox.

**Python comes with 200+ built-in modules:**
- **math** - Mathematical functions (sqrt, sin, cos)
- **random** - Generate random numbers
- **datetime** - Work with dates and times
- **json** - Handle JSON data (we used this!)
- **csv** - Handle CSV files (we used this too!)
- **pathlib** - File system operations (Path)

**Why use modules?**
1. **Don't reinvent the wheel** - Use tested, optimized code
2. **Save time** - Focus on your unique logic
3. **Cleaner code** - Keep your files small and focused
4. **Community knowledge** - Benefit from expert implementations

**Real-world analogy:** Calculator vs Computer
- Without modules: Like doing all math in your head
- With modules: Like having a calculator, spreadsheet, and computer
