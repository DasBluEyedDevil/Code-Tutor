type: "KEY_POINT"
title: "Django's Design Philosophy"
---

**Core Principles:**

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Define things once, reference everywhere
2. **Explicit is better than implicit** - Clear code over magic
3. **Loose coupling** - Components work independently
4. **Consistency** - APIs follow predictable patterns

**The Trade-off:**
- Django has a steeper learning curve than Flask
- More opinionated structure (less flexibility)
- Larger footprint for simple APIs
- But: Much faster development for full web applications

**Our Project: Personal Finance Tracker**
Throughout this module, we'll build a finance tracker with:
- User authentication
- Transaction management
- Budget categories
- Monthly reports
- Admin dashboard for data management
