- **OOP organizes complex systems** - RPG demonstrates real-world structure
- **Inheritance creates hierarchies** - Character → Warrior/Mage/Rogue
- **Polymorphism enables flexibility** - Same combat loop, different behaviors
- **Encapsulation protects data** - Health/mana validated through properties
- **Properties provide controlled access** - Can't set invalid values
- **Class attributes track shared data** - Total character count
- **Method overriding customizes behavior** - Each class has unique attacks
- **super() maintains parent functionality** - Call parent then add custom logic
