- **Encapsulation = bundling data with methods** that control access
- **Public (name)** - normal access by everyone
- **Protected (_name)** - convention for internal use
- **Private (__name)** - name mangling, harder to access
- **@property decorator** - makes method look like attribute
- **@property.setter** - validates and controls setting
- **Read-only properties** - only @property, no setter
- **Computed properties** - calculate value on-the-fly, no storage needed
