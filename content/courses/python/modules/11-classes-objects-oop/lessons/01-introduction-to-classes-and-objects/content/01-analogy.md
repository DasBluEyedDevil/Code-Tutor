title: "The Concept: Blueprint vs. House"
---

**Think of it like houses:**

- **Class** = Blueprint 📋
  - The design/template
  - Defines what a house should have (rooms, doors, windows)
  - You can't live in a blueprint!

- **Object** = Actual House 🏠
  - Built from the blueprint
  - Each house can have different colors, sizes, furniture
  - You can have many houses from one blueprint

**Example:**
- **Class: Dog** (blueprint)
  - All dogs have: name, age, breed
  - All dogs can: bark, eat, sleep

- **Objects: Actual dogs** (instances)
  - Buddy (3 years old, Golden Retriever)
  - Max (5 years old, Beagle)
  - Luna (2 years old, Husky)

**Why use classes?**
1. **Organization** - Group related data and functions
2. **Reusability** - Create multiple objects from one class
3. **Modeling** - Represent real-world things in code
4. **Maintenance** - Change blueprint, all objects benefit
