title: "Key Takeaways"
---

- **Polymorphism = 'many forms'** - Same interface, different implementations
- **Method overriding enables polymorphism** - Children override parent methods
- **Write code to interfaces** - Don't check types, call methods
- **Duck typing: 'If it walks like a duck...'** - Behavior matters, not type
- **Polymorphic functions work with any compatible type** - Very flexible
- **Add new types without changing existing code** - Open/Closed Principle
- **NotImplementedError in base class** - Forces children to implement
- **Python doesn't require inheritance for polymorphism** - Just matching methods
