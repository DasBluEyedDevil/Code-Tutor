**Think of it like genetics:**

**Parent Class (Base/Superclass)**
- Defines common features
- Example: Animal
  - All animals: eat, sleep, breathe

**Child Class (Derived/Subclass)**
- Inherits from parent
- Adds specific features
- Examples:
  - Dog (Animal) → adds bark()
  - Cat (Animal) → adds meow()
  - Bird (Animal) → adds fly()

**Inheritance Benefits:**

1. **Code Reuse** ♻️
   - Write common code once in parent
   - All children automatically get it

2. **Organization** 📁
   - Clear hierarchy
   - Related classes grouped

3. **Extensibility** 🔧
   - Add new types easily
   - Override behavior when needed

4. **Polymorphism** 🎭
   - Treat different types uniformly
   - More on this in next lesson

**Real-world examples:**
- Vehicle → Car, Motorcycle, Truck
- Shape → Circle, Square, Triangle
- Employee → Manager, Developer, Designer
- Account → CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount
