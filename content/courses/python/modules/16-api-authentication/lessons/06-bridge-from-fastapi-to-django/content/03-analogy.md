**Understanding Framework Philosophies Through LEGO**

**FastAPI = LEGO Technic**

When you buy a LEGO Technic set, you get:
- Individual gears, axles, beams, connectors
- A suggested design (but you can build anything)
- Complete control over every mechanism
- The ability to modify and extend endlessly

Building takes longer, but you understand exactly how everything works. Want to change the gear ratio? Replace one piece. Want a different motor? Swap it out.

**Django = Pre-Built LEGO Set (with instructions)**

When you buy a pre-built LEGO set like a Star Wars ship:
- Pieces are designed to work together
- Clear step-by-step instructions
- You follow the proven path
- Result looks professional quickly

Building is faster because decisions are made for you. Want to add a new wing? The manual shows you how. Want to completely redesign it? That's harder—the pieces are optimized for the intended design.

**The Key Insight:**

```
FastAPI Developer: "I need user authentication..."
→ Research: bcrypt vs argon2, passlib vs built-in, JWT vs sessions
→ Install: passlib, python-jose, pydantic-settings
→ Implement: 50-100 lines of code
→ Result: Exactly what you need, full understanding

Django Developer: "I need user authentication..."
→ Run: python manage.py startapp accounts
→ Configure: INSTALLED_APPS, AUTH_USER_MODEL
→ Result: Login, logout, password reset, permissions—done
```

**Neither Is Better:**

- Building a custom car? Use LEGO Technic (FastAPI)
- Building a complete Hogwarts castle? Use the pre-built set (Django)

**In Web Development:**
- Custom API for a mobile app? FastAPI
- Full website with admin, blog, e-commerce? Django
