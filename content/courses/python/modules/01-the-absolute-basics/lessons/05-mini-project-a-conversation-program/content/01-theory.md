**Congratulations!** You've learned the fundamentals of Python:

- ✅ How to display output with `print()`
- ✅ How to get input from users with `input()`
- ✅ How to store information in variables
- ✅ How to create clean, readable output with f-strings

Now it's time to put it all together in a real project!

**Project Goal:** Create an interactive chatbot that has a multi-turn conversation with the user.

**Think of it like building with LEGO blocks:**

You've been learning about individual blocks (print, input, variables, f-strings). Now we're going to snap them together to build something cool! Each block you've learned is simple on its own, but when combined, they can create something that feels almost magical.

**What makes a good conversation program?**

- **It's personal** - Uses the person's name and remembers what they said
- **It's engaging** - Asks interesting questions
- **It's responsive** - Reacts to what the user tells it
- **It's polite** - Greets and says goodbye

Your program will do all of these things!
