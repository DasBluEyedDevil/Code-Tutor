- You can combine `print()`, `input()`, variables, and f-strings to create interactive programs
- `input()` always returns text (a string), even if the user types a number
- Use `int()` to convert text to a whole number before doing math
- Good programs are more than just question-and-answer—they process information and provide value
- Planning your program's structure before coding makes it easier to build
- Visual formatting (lines, spacing, emojis) makes output more readable and engaging
- Using variables lets you reference information throughout your program
- The best programs reflect your creativity and interests!
