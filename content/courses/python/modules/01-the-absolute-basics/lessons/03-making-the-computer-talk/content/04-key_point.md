- `input()` pauses your program and waits for the user to type something and press Enter
- Variables are like labeled storage boxes that hold information
- You create a variable with: `variable_name = value`
- The `=` sign means "store this value" (not "equals" like in math)
- Variable names should be descriptive: `name`, `age`, `color` (not `x`, `y`, `z`)
- When using a variable in `print()`, DON'T put it in quotes
- You can put the prompt text inside `input()`: `input("Your question here: ")`
- Variables let you store information and reuse it throughout your program
