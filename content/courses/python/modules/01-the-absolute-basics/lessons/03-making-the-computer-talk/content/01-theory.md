Imagine you're at a drive-through restaurant. You pull up to the speaker and say your order. The speaker talks back: 'That'll be $8.50. Please pull forward.' Then you drive to the window, hand over your money, and receive your food.

**That's a conversation!** You give information, they respond. Back and forth.

In programming, we call this **input and output**:

- **Output** = The computer talking to YOU (like displaying text on screen)
- **Input** = YOU talking to the computer (like typing something)

So far, we've only done output with `print()`. Now we're going to learn input, which lets your program ask questions and wait for answers. This transforms your code from a one-way announcement into a two-way conversation!

**Real-world examples:**

- When Netflix asks "Who's watching?" and you click your profile - that's input
- When you type your password and hit Enter - that's input
- When a game asks "What's your name?" and you type it - that's input

Now YOUR programs can do the same thing!
