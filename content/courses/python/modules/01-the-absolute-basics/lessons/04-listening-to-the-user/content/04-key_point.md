- You can put a prompt directly inside `input()`: `input("Your question here: ")`
- Always add a space at the end of your prompt for better formatting
- You can multiply strings: `"=" * 20` creates 20 equal signs
- F-strings (formatted strings) are the modern way to insert variables into text
- F-strings syntax: `f"text {variable} more text"`
- The `f` goes BEFORE the opening quote
- Variables go inside `{curly braces}` WITHOUT quotes
- F-strings make your code cleaner and easier to read than using lots of commas in `print()`
