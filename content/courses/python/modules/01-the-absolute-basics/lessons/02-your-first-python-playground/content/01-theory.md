Before you can speak Python to a computer, you need a place where the computer can listen and respond. Think of it like this:

- If you want to cook, you need a **kitchen**
- If you want to paint, you need a **canvas**
- If you want to write Python code, you need a **development environment**

Don't let that fancy term scare you! A 'development environment' is just a place where you write code and see what happens when you run it. It's your programming workspace.

**Good news:** Code Tutor has a built-in code editor! Just write your code in the editor panel and click 'Run Code' to execute it.

**To run Python code, you'll need Python 3.13+ installed:**

**Option 1: Traditional Installation**
1. Download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. During installation, check 'Add Python to PATH'
3. Restart Code Tutor

**Option 2: Modern Installation with uv (Recommended)**

`uv` is a blazing-fast Python package and project manager. It can install Python for you!

```bash
# Install uv (one-time setup)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install Python 3.13
uv python install 3.13
```

Once Python is installed, you can write and run code directly in this app!

**Note:** This course recommends Python 3.13+. Python 3.14 features are noted where applicable throughout the course.

**Think of it like learning to drive:** You don't buy a car on day one. You use a driving school's car first, then get your own when you're ready. Code Tutor is your driving school!
