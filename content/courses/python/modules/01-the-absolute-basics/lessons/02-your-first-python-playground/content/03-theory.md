Let's examine some new things in this code:

- **`print("text", 5 + 3)`** - You can print multiple things in one line! Separate them with commas. Python will display them with a space in between.

  ```python
  print("The answer is", 42)  # Shows: The answer is 42
  ```

- **`\n`** - This is a special code that means 'new line' or 'press Enter'. It's like hitting the Enter key in the middle of your text.

  ```python
  print("Line 1\nLine 2")  # Shows two separate lines
  ```

- **`5 + 3`** - When you write math without quotes, Python actually calculates it! The result (8) gets printed.

  ```python
  print(5 + 3)     # Shows: 8
  print("5 + 3")   # Shows: 5 + 3 (just text)
  ```

- **Emojis** - Yes, Python supports emojis in strings! You can use them just like any other text. They make your output more fun and readable.

**The key concept:** Anything inside quotation marks is displayed exactly as written. Anything outside quotes (like `5 + 3`) is executed as Python code.
