Let's examine some new things in this code:

<li>**`print("text", 5 + 3)`** - You can print multiple things in one line! Separate them with commas. Python will display them with a space in between.

<pre>`print("The answer is", 42)  # Shows: The answer is 42`</pre></li><li>**`\n`** - This is a special code that means 'new line' or 'press Enter'. It's like hitting the Enter key in the middle of your text.

<pre>`print("Line 1\nLine 2")  # Shows two separate lines`</pre></li><li>**`5 + 3`** - When you write math without quotes, Python actually calculates it! The result (8) gets printed.

```
print(5 + 3)     # Shows: 8
print("5 + 3")   # Shows: 5 + 3 (just text)
```
</li><li>**Emojis** - Yes, Python supports emojis in strings! You can use them just like any other text. They make your output more fun and readable.

</li>
**The key concept:** Anything inside quotation marks is displayed exactly as written. Anything outside quotes (like `5 + 3`) is executed as Python code.
