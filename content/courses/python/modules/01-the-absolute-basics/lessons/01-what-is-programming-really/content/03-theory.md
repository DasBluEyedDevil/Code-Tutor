Let's break down what just happened:

- **`print()`** - This is a **function** (we'll learn more about these later). Think of it as a command or action word, like 'display' or 'show'. It tells Python: 'take whatever is inside the parentheses and show it to the user.'
- **`("Hello, World!")`** - The parentheses `( )` are like a lunchbox—they carry the information that `print` needs. Inside, we have `"Hello, World!"` wrapped in quotes.
- **`"Hello, World!"`** - The quotation marks tell Python: 'This is text (what programmers call a **string**), not a command.' Without quotes, Python would think `Hello` is a command and get confused.
- **`#`** - Everything after a `#` on a line is a **comment**. Python completely ignores it. Comments are notes you leave for yourself or other programmers to explain what the code does.

**Why does this matter?** Because if you wrote `print(Hello, World!)` without quotes, Python would say 'Error! I don't know what Hello is!' The quotes are crucial.
