This is the classic first program every developer writes. The print() function displays text to the console. **Expected Output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

```python
# This is your first Python program!
# The '#' symbol creates a comment - notes for humans that the computer ignores

# Tell the computer to print (display) a message
print("Hello, World!")

# That's it! This simple instruction tells Python:
# "Show the text 'Hello, World!' on the screen"
```
