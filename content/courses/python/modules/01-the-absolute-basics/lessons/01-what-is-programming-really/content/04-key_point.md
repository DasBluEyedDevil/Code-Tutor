- Programming is like giving very detailed, step-by-step instructions to a computer
- Python is a language designed to be readable and beginner-friendly
- `print()` is your first Python command—it displays text on the screen
- Text (strings) must be wrapped in quotation marks: `"like this"` or `'like this'`
- Comments (lines starting with `#`) are notes for humans—Python ignores them
- Python is case-sensitive: `print` works, but `Print` doesn't
