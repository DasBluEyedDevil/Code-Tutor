Imagine you're teaching a very literal-minded friend how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You can't just say 'make a sandwich'—you have to break it down into tiny, specific steps:

- Pick up the bread bag
- Open the bag
- Take out two slices of bread
- Place them on the counter
- Pick up the jar of peanut butter
- Twist the lid counter-clockwise to open it
- ...and so on

**That's exactly what programming is.**

A computer is like that very literal friend. It's incredibly fast and never gets tired, but it only does <em>exactly</em> what you tell it to do, in <em>exactly</em> the order you tell it. If you forget a step or put them in the wrong order, it won't figure it out—it'll either do the wrong thing or stop and say "I don't understand."

**Python is the language you'll use to give these instructions.** Just like English or Spanish is a language humans use to communicate, Python is a language humans use to communicate with computers.

The beautiful thing? Python was designed to be as close to plain English as possible, so it reads almost like a recipe or a set of instructions you'd give to a friend.
