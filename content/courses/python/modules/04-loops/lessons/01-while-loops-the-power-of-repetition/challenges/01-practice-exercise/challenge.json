  "description": "Build a **Number Guessing Game** where the computer picks a random number and the user tries to guess it.\n\n**Game Rules:**\n\n- Computer picks a random number between 1 and 20\n- User keeps guessing until they get it right\n- After each guess, tell the user if they're too high or too low\n- Count how many guesses it took\n\n**Example game:**\n\n```text\n=== Number Guessing Game ===\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 20...\n\nEnter your guess: 10\nToo low! Try again.\n\nEnter your guess: 15\nToo high! Try again.\n\nEnter your guess: 13\nToo low! Try again.\n\nEnter your guess: 14\n🎉 Correct! You got it in 4 guesses!\n```\n\n**Hints:**\n\n- Use `import random` and `random.randint(1, 20)` to pick a number\n- Use a while loop that continues until guess equals the secret number\n- Use a counter variable to track attempts",
