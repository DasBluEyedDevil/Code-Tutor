- **`patch()`** temporarily replaces objects during tests
- **`return_value`** sets what the mock returns
- **`side_effect`** raises exceptions or returns sequences
- **Patch where it's used**, not where it's defined
- **`pytest-mock`** provides a cleaner `mocker` fixture
- Don't over-mock - test real behavior when possible
