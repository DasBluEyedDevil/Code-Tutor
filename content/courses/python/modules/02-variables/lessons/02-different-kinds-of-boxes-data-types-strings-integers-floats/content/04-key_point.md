- Python has four main basic data types: **str** (strings), **int** (integers), **float** (decimals), and **bool** (True/False)
- **Strings** are text in quotes: `"Hello"` or `'Hello'`
- **Integers** are whole numbers without quotes: `42`, `-5`, `0`
- **Floats** are decimal numbers: `3.14`, `19.99`, `-2.5`
- **Booleans** are `True` or `False` (capitalized, no quotes)
- Use `type(variable)` to check what type of data a variable holds
- You can do math with integers and floats, but NOT directly with strings
- Mixing int and float in math gives you a float result
- You CAN multiply a string by an integer to repeat it: `"Hi" * 3` = `"HiHiHi"`
- Each type has its own "rules" and "superpowers" - use the right type for the right job!
- Python follows IEEE 754 standard for floats (64-bit, ~15-17 decimal digits precision)
