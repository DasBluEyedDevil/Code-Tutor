- Variables are like labeled boxes that store information
- Create a variable with: `variable_name = value`
- Variable names should be descriptive: `age` not `x`
- Variable naming rules: start with letter, no spaces, use underscores
- Text (strings) needs quotes: `"Sarah"`
- Numbers don't need quotes: `25`
- True/False are special values (Booleans): `True`, `False`
- You can change a variable's value anytime
- Good variable names make your code readable and maintainable
