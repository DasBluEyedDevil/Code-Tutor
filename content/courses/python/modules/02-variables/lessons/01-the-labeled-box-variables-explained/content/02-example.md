**Expected Output:**
```
Customer Information:
Name: Sarah
Age: 28
Item Price: $19.99
Student Discount Eligible: True

Updated Age: 29
```

```python
# Creating variables - like labeling boxes

# A variable that stores text (a person's name)
name = "Sarah"

# A variable that stores a number (age)
age = 28

# A variable that stores a decimal number (price)
price = 19.99

# A variable that stores a True/False value
is_student = True

# Now let's use these variables
print("Customer Information:")
print(f"Name: {name}")
print(f"Age: {age}")
print(f"Item Price: ${price}")
print(f"Student Discount Eligible: {is_student}")

# You can change what's in a variable (relabel the box)
age = 29  # Happy birthday!
print(f"\nUpdated Age: {age}")
```
