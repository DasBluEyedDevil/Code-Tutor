- **7 Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`
- **Division has two tools**:
  - `/` (regular) always gives a decimal (float)
  - `//` (floor) gives only the whole number part (int)

- **Modulo (%)** gives you the *remainder* after division - perfect for finding leftovers
- **Order matters**: Python follows PEMDAS - use parentheses to control the order
- **Power operator (**)** is for exponentiation, not ^ (which means something else in Python)
- **Mixing types**: Operations with floats produce floats; division (/) always produces a float
- **The floor + modulo duo** is your best friend for breaking numbers into parts (like hours/minutes)

### Before Moving On:
Make sure you can:

- Explain the difference between `/` and `//`
- Know when to use `%` to find remainders
- Use parentheses to control the order of operations
- Combine operators to solve real-world math problems

### Coming Up Next:
In the next lesson, you'll build a **Simple Calculator** that puts all these operators to work, letting users choose which operation to perform. You'll tie together everything you've learned about variables, data types, type conversion, and operators into one complete mini-project!
