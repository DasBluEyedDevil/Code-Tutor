Congratulations! You've reached your first **mini-project** - a complete program that ties together everything you've learned in Module 2.

Think of this as building your first real tool. Up until now, you've been learning individual skills:

- **Variables**: Storing information in labeled boxes
- **Data types**: Understanding str, int, float, bool
- **Type conversion**: Converting between data types
- **Operators**: Performing calculations with +, -, *, /, //, %, **

Now you're going to combine all of these into a **Simple Calculator** that works like this:

```
Welcome to Simple Calculator!

Choose an operation:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Floor Division (//)
6. Modulo (%)
7. Exponentiation (**)

Enter your choice (1-7): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5

Result: 10 + 5 = 15
```

This isn't just a learning exercise - you're building a *real, functional program* that you could actually use!

### Real-World Connection:
Every calculator app on your phone, every spreadsheet formula, every e-commerce checkout total - they all work on these same principles. You're learning the foundation of computational thinking.
