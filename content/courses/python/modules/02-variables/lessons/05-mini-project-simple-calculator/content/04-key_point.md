- **You can build real programs** with just the basics: variables, data types, operators, and input/output
- **Type conversion is crucial**: `input()` always returns strings - convert them to int or float as needed
- **Combining concepts** creates powerful programs - the whole is greater than the sum of its parts
- **User experience matters**: Clear menus, formatted output, and friendly messages make programs better
- **Conditional logic (if-elif-else)** lets programs make decisions based on user input
- **Planning before coding** helps - think through: input → processing → output
- **Every large program** is built from these same fundamentals

### Module 2 Complete! 🎉
You've mastered:

- ✅ Variables and how Python stores data
- ✅ The four basic data types (str, int, float, bool)
- ✅ Converting between data types
- ✅ All 7 arithmetic operators
- ✅ Building a complete, functional program

### What's Next:
In **Module 3: Making Decisions**, you'll dive deep into conditional logic:

- if-elif-else statements
- Comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=)
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- Nested conditions
- Building programs that make intelligent decisions

You got a preview of if-elif-else in this calculator - now you'll master it!

**Before moving on:** Take the Module 2 Quiz to test your understanding. Aim for 70% or higher to ensure you're ready for Module 3.
