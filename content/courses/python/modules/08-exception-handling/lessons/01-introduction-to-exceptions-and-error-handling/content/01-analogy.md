title: "The Concept: Catching a Falling Vase"
---

Imagine you're juggling expensive vases. Without preparation, if you drop one, it SHATTERS on the floor and the show ends. But what if you placed soft pillows on the floor? The vase might still fall (error happens), but instead of shattering (program crash), it lands safely on the pillow (error is caught and handled), and you can keep juggling (program continues).

This is **error handling**. Errors WILL happen (users type wrong input, files don't exist, networks fail). The question is: does your program crash spectacularly, or does it catch the error gracefully and continue?

**Real-world scenario:** You're running an ATM program. A user types 'abc' instead of a number for withdrawal amount. Without error handling, the ATM crashes and displays a cryptic error. WITH error handling, it shows "Please enter a valid number" and lets them try again. Which would you prefer?
