  "description": "Build a file manager for your Personal Finance Tracker that:\n\n1. Creates an organized directory structure for financial data\n2. Finds all transaction files (JSON, CSV)\n3. Reports file sizes and modification dates\n4. Backs up files to an archive folder\n5. Generates a directory summary report\n\n**Use pathlib features:**\n- Path() / operator for joining paths\n- .mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True) for directory creation\n- .glob() and .rglob() for finding files\n- .stat() for file metadata\n- .suffix and .stem for file name operations",
