  "description": "Build an async file processor for your Personal Finance Tracker that:\n\n1. Reads multiple monthly transaction files concurrently\n2. Aggregates transaction totals by category\n3. Writes a summary report asynchronously\n4. Compares performance with sequential reading\n\n**Use aiofiles features:**\n- `async with aiofiles.open()` for file operations\n- `asyncio.gather()` for concurrent processing\n- `await` for all async operations",
