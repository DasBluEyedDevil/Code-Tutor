title: "The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle"
---


**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** means writing tests BEFORE implementation.

**The Cycle:**
1. **RED** - Write a failing test
2. **GREEN** - Write minimum code to pass
3. **REFACTOR** - Improve code while tests pass
4. Repeat

**Benefits:**
- Forces you to think about design first
- Guarantees test coverage
- Small, focused changes
- Confidence in refactoring
