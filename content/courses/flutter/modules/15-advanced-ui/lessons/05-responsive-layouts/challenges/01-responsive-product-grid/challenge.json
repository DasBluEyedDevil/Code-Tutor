  "description": "Build a product grid that adapts its column count based on available width.",
  "instructions": "Create a ProductGrid widget that displays product cards in a grid. Use LayoutBuilder to calculate the number of columns: 1 column for width < 400px, 2 columns for width < 700px, 3 columns for width < 1000px, and 4 columns for larger widths. Each product card should show an image placeholder, title, and price. The grid should have 16px spacing between items.",
