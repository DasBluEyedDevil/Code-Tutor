**Building Apps for Everyone**

Accessibility (often abbreviated as a11y) means making your app usable by people with disabilities. This includes:

| Disability Type | Examples | Assistive Technology |
|-----------------|----------|----------------------|
| Visual | Blindness, low vision, color blindness | Screen readers, magnifiers |
| Motor | Limited mobility, tremors, paralysis | Switch devices, voice control |
| Auditory | Deafness, hard of hearing | Captions, visual alerts |
| Cognitive | Dyslexia, ADHD, memory issues | Simplified interfaces, consistent navigation |

**Why It Matters:**

1. **Ethical responsibility** - Everyone deserves equal access to technology
2. **Legal requirements** - Many countries mandate accessibility (ADA, WCAG compliance)
3. **Business impact** - 15% of world population has some disability
4. **Better UX for everyone** - Accessibility improvements help all users

**WCAG Guidelines:**

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) define accessibility standards:

- **Perceivable** - Users must be able to perceive the content
- **Operable** - Users must be able to operate the interface
- **Understandable** - Content must be understandable
- **Robust** - Content must work with assistive technologies

**WCAG Levels:**

| Level | Description | Target |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| A | Minimum accessibility | Required |
| AA | Addresses major barriers | Recommended |
| AAA | Highest level | Enhanced |

Most apps should aim for **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** compliance.
