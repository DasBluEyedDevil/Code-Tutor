  "instructions": "Create an AccessibleProductCard widget that displays a product image, name, price, and rating. The card should: (1) Use MergeSemantics to combine all content into one announcement, (2) Exclude the decorative star icons but announce the rating value, (3) Be tappable with proper button semantics, (4) Have a minimum touch target of 48x48 dp.",
