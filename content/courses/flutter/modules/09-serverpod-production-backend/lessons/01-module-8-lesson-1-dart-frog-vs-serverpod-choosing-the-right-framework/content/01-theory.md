---


You have learned Dart Frog in Module 7 - a lightweight, file-based routing framework perfect for simple APIs and learning backend concepts. Now it is time to meet Serverpod, its more powerful sibling.

Think of it like this:
- **Dart Frog** is like a Swiss Army knife - compact, versatile, and great for quick jobs
- **Serverpod** is like a full workshop - everything you need for serious production work

Both are excellent tools. The key is knowing when to use each one. By the end of this lesson, you will have a clear decision framework for choosing between them.

**What You Will Learn:**
- The fundamental philosophy behind each framework
- Feature-by-feature comparison
- Real-world scenarios where each shines
- How to make the right choice for your project
