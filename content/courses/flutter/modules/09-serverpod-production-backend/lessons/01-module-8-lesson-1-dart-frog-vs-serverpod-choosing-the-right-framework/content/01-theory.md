title: "Two Paths to Dart Backend Development"
---


You have learned Dart Frog in Module 8 - a lightweight, file-based routing framework perfect for simple APIs and learning backend concepts. Now it is time to meet Serverpod, its more powerful sibling.

Think of it like this:
- **Dart Frog** is like a Swiss Army knife - compact, versatile, and great for quick jobs
- **Serverpod** is like a full workshop - everything you need for serious production work

Both are excellent tools. The key is knowing when to use each one. By the end of this lesson, you will have a clear decision framework for choosing between them.

> **Version Note:** This course teaches Serverpod 2.x patterns. Serverpod 3.0 (released December 2025) introduced significant changes including a new authentication system (Relic) and web server. The core concepts taught here (endpoints, ORM, code generation) remain foundational, but specific APIs differ in 3.x. When starting new projects, check [serverpod.dev](https://serverpod.dev) for the latest version and migration guides.

**What You Will Learn:**
- The fundamental philosophy behind each framework
- Feature-by-feature comparison
- Real-world scenarios where each shines
- How to make the right choice for your project
