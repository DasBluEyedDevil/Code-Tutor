    {
      "id": "q1",
      "text": "What are the three packages created when you run 'serverpod create my_app'?",
      "options": [
        "my_app_frontend, my_app_backend, my_app_shared",
        "my_app_server, my_app_client, my_app_flutter",
        "my_app_api, my_app_models, my_app_ui",
        "server, client, shared"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Serverpod creates three packages: my_app_server (the backend), my_app_client (generated client library), and my_app_flutter (sample Flutter app). The client package is auto-generated from the server code."

        "serverpod build",
        "serverpod generate",
        "dart build",
        "serverpod compile"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The 'serverpod generate' command regenerates all auto-generated code, including the client package. You should run this after modifying endpoints or protocol definitions."

      "text": "What services does Docker run for Serverpod development?",
      "options": [

        "MongoDB and Redis",
        "PostgreSQL and Redis",
        "SQLite and Redis"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Serverpod uses PostgreSQL as its database and Redis for caching and session storage. Both are containerized using Docker for easy local development."

      "options": [
        "In Dart classes in lib/src/models/",
        "In YAML files in lib/src/protocol/",
        "In JSON files in config/",
        "In SQL files in migrations/"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Serverpod uses YAML files in the lib/src/protocol/ directory to define data models. From these YAML definitions, Serverpod generates Dart classes for both server and client."

      "text": "What is the purpose of the my_app_client package?",
      "options": [
        "It contains the Flutter UI components",
        "It is a generated package that Flutter apps import to call server endpoints",
        "It stores client-side configuration",
        "It handles local database operations"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The my_app_client package is automatically generated from your server code. Flutter apps import this package to get type-safe access to all server endpoints and data models."
