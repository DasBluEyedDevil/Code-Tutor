Congratulations! You now have a fully functional Serverpod development environment. You have:

- Installed the Serverpod CLI
- Created a new project with three packages
- Started Docker with PostgreSQL and Redis
- Configured VS Code for Serverpod development
- Run your first API server with hot reload
- Tested an endpoint

**In the next lessons, you will learn:**

- Defining data models with Serverpod's protocol YAML
- Creating CRUD endpoints with the built-in ORM
- Authentication and authorization
- Real-time features with streaming
- File uploads and storage
- Deployment to production

Your Serverpod journey has begun. The setup you completed today is the foundation for building powerful, type-safe, full-stack Dart applications.
