### Without Security Rules = No Locks
- 🏦 Bank with no locks on vault
- 💰 Anyone can walk in and take money
- 📁 Anyone can see everyone's account balances
- ❌ **This is test mode!**

### With Security Rules = Multi-Layer Security
- 🔐 **Locks** (authentication required)
- 👮 **Guards** (authorization checks)
- 🎫 **ID verification** (user owns the data)
- 📹 **Cameras** (audit logs)
- ✅ **This is production mode!**

**Security rules are your bank vault's locks and guards.**
