**Every successful app needs a backend.**

- **Instagram**: Stores billions of photos and user data
- **WhatsApp**: Delivers messages in real-time to millions of users
- **Uber**: Coordinates drivers and riders across the globe
- **99% of apps** you use daily rely on a backend
- **Without a backend**, your app can't store data, sync across devices, or communicate with other users

In this module, you'll learn to connect your Flutter app to a real backend, transforming it from a local-only app to a fully connected, cloud-powered application.
