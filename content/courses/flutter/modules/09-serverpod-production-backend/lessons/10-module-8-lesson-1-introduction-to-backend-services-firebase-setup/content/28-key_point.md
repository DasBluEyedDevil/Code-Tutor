### Answer 1: B
**Correct**: To store data, process requests, and coordinate users across devices

The backend handles everything that can't be done on the user's device: permanent data storage, processing for multiple users, enforcing security rules, and syncing data across devices.

### Answer 2: B
**Correct**: It requires no backend code and has official Flutter support

Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) that eliminates the need to write and maintain server code. FlutterFire (official Firebase Flutter plugin) makes integration seamless with excellent documentation.

### Answer 3: B
**Correct**: It generates firebase_options.dart with your project configuration

The FlutterFire CLI automatically registers your app with Firebase and generates a `firebase_options.dart` file containing all the configuration needed to connect your Flutter app to your Firebase project across all platforms.
