A **backend** is a server (computer running 24/7 in the cloud) that:

1. **Stores Data**: User accounts, posts, messages, photos
2. **Processes Requests**: Validates login, searches data, sends notifications
3. **Coordinates Users**: Syncs data across devices, enables real-time features
4. **Enforces Rules**: Who can see what, who can do what
