**Push notifications and analytics are essential for app success.**

### Push Notifications:
- **Increase engagement by 88%** (users return more often)
- **Send time-sensitive updates** (messages, orders, breaking news)
- **Re-engage inactive users** (bring them back to your app)
- **95% of successful apps** use push notifications

### Analytics:
- **Understand user behavior** (what features they use most)
- **Track conversion rates** (signup, purchases)
- **Identify problems** (where users get stuck)
- **Data-driven decisions** (build what users actually want)

**Without notifications and analytics, you're flying blind!**
