This lesson teaches you how to work with databases in Serverpod. You will master the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system that lets you interact with PostgreSQL using pure Dart code instead of raw SQL strings.

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Configure database connections in Serverpod
- Define database models using YAML protocol files
- Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with type-safe queries
- Create relationships between tables (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Run database migrations to evolve your schema
- Use transactions for atomic operations that either fully succeed or fully fail
- Build complex queries with filters, sorting, and pagination

These skills are essential for any production application that needs to persist data beyond a single session.
