Modern mobile apps must work reliably regardless of network conditions. Users expect apps to function in subways, airplanes, and areas with poor connectivity.

**The Problem with Online-First:**
- Loading spinners frustrate users
- Network failures cause data loss
- Slow connections degrade experience
- Battery drain from constant network checks

**Offline-First Benefits:**
- Instant UI responses
- Data safety during network issues
- Reduced server load
- Better battery life
- Works everywhere

**Real-World Examples:**
- Google Docs: Edit offline, sync when connected
- Spotify: Download playlists for offline listening
- Notion: Local-first with background sync
- Linear: Optimistic updates with conflict resolution
