  "description": "Create a navigation shell that switches between bottom navigation, navigation rail, and sidebar based on screen width.",
  "instructions": "Build a ResponsiveNavigationShell widget that wraps child content with appropriate navigation. For screens < 600px wide, use a BottomNavigationBar. For screens 600-900px, use a NavigationRail. For screens > 900px, use a NavigationDrawer (permanent sidebar). All navigation types should have the same 4 destinations: Home, Search, Favorites, Profile. The selected index and onDestinationSelected callback should be passed as parameters.",
