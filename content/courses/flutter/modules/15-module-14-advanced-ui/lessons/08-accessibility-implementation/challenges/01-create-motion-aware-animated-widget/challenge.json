  "description": "Build a notification card that respects reduced motion preferences.",
  "instructions": "Create a NotificationCard widget that slides in from the right when shown. When the user has reduced motion enabled, it should fade in instantly instead of sliding. The card should include: (1) Check for reduced motion preference using MediaQuery, (2) Animate with slide + fade when motion is allowed, (3) Show instantly or with simple fade when reduced motion is preferred, (4) Include a dismiss button with proper semantics.",
