  "description": "Create a profile header that adapts gracefully to large text sizes.",
  "instructions": "Build a ProfileHeader widget that displays a user avatar, name, title, and action buttons. At normal text sizes, show horizontal layout. At large text sizes (>1.5x), switch to a vertical layout that stacks elements. Requirements: (1) Check text scale factor using MediaQuery, (2) Horizontal layout at normal sizes with avatar, text, and buttons in a row, (3) Vertical layout at large sizes stacking avatar on top, then text, then buttons, (4) Icons should scale with text size, (5) Ensure minimum touch targets of 48x48.",
