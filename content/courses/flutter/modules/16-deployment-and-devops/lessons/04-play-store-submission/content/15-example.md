## Responding to User Reviews

Best practices:
1. Reply to negative reviews within 24-48 hours
2. Be professional and empathetic
3. Ask for specifics if issue unclear
4. Offer to help via email for complex issues
5. Update reply after fixing reported issues
6. Thank users who report bugs constructively

Example responses:

# Bad review: "App crashes every time I open it! 1 star!"

Response: "We're sorry about the crashes you're experiencing. 
This is definitely not the experience we want you to have. 
Could you email support@example.com with your device model 
and Android version? We'd like to investigate and fix this ASAP."

# After fixing:

Updated response: "We've released version 2.1.3 which fixes 
the crash affecting [device type]. Please update and let us 
know if you still experience issues. Thanks for your patience!"

If you receive a policy warning:
1. Do NOT ignore it - can lead to removal
