**Answer Honestly and Accurately**

Misrepresenting your app's content to get a lower age rating is a policy violation that can result in:
- App removal from Play Store
- Account suspension or termination
- Loss of developer privileges

**Common Rating Factors:**

1. **User-Generated Content:**
   - If users can post text, images, or videos: Higher rating
   - If UGC can be moderated before display: May lower impact
   - Social features typically require 12+ minimum

2. **Violence:**
   - Cartoon violence: Usually acceptable for all ages
   - Realistic violence against humans: Teen+ rating
   - Graphic violence: Mature rating

3. **In-App Purchases:**
   - Must be disclosed in questionnaire
   - Affects some regional ratings
   - Gambling mechanics (even without real money) flag content

4. **Advertisements:**
   - If ads can contain mature content: Affects rating
   - Use child-directed ad settings if targeting kids

**Update Ratings When Content Changes:**

If you add new features that affect content rating (e.g., adding chat features, violent content, or gambling mechanics), you must update your questionnaire and get a new rating.
