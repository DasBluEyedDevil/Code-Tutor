**Google Play Console Overview**

Google Play Console is your command center for publishing and managing Android apps. From here you can:
- Upload and publish your app
- Manage store listings and assets
- Track performance metrics and user reviews
- Configure pricing and distribution
- Run A/B tests on store listings
- Monitor crashes and ANRs (Application Not Responding)

**Developer Account Setup**

Before submitting your first app, you need a Google Play Developer account:

1. **Create Account:** Visit play.google.com/console and sign in with a Google account
2. **Pay Registration Fee:** One-time $25 fee (compared to Apple's $99/year)
3. **Complete Identity Verification:** Required for all new accounts since 2021
4. **Accept Developer Agreement:** Review and agree to Google Play policies

**Identity Verification Requirements:**

| Account Type | Verification Needed |
|--------------|--------------------|
| Individual | Government ID, address verification |
| Organization | D-U-N-S number, business documents, authorized representative |

**Verification Timeline:**
- Individual accounts: Usually 24-48 hours
- Organization accounts: 3-7 business days (D-U-N-S lookup can take longer)

**Account Types Comparison:**

- **Individual:** Personal account, apps published under your name, simpler setup
- **Organization:** Business account, requires legal entity verification, can add team members with different roles
