**Understanding App Review**

Apple's App Review team evaluates every submission against the App Store Review Guidelines. Review typically takes 24-48 hours but can be longer.

**Common Rejection Reasons:**

1. **Performance Issues:**
   - App crashes on launch
   - Broken features or dead ends
   - Placeholder content or lorem ipsum
   - Incomplete app experience

2. **Business Model:**
   - Using external payment for digital goods
   - Not using Apple's in-app purchase for subscriptions
   - Unclear or deceptive pricing

3. **Design:**
   - Poor user interface
   - Copying iOS system UI inappropriately
   - Not following Human Interface Guidelines
   - App too simple (could be a website)

4. **Safety:**
   - User-generated content without moderation
   - Missing content reporting mechanism
   - Inadequate privacy information

5. **Metadata:**
   - Screenshots don't match app
   - Description misleading
   - Irrelevant keywords
   - Mentioning other platforms (Android)

**Avoiding Rejection:**

- Test thoroughly on real devices
- Review Guidelines before submitting
- Provide demo account if login required
- Explain non-obvious features in review notes
- Respond promptly to reviewer questions
