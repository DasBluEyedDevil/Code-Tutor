**What is TestFlight?**

TestFlight is Apple's official beta testing platform, allowing you to distribute pre-release builds to testers before App Store release.

**Testing Types:**

**1. Internal Testing:**
- Up to 100 testers from your App Store Connect team
- No review required - builds available immediately
- Testers must have App Store Connect role
- Great for: Development team, QA, stakeholders

**2. External Testing:**
- Up to 10,000 testers per app
- Requires beta app review (usually 24-48 hours)
- Testers invited via email or public link
- Can create multiple tester groups
- Great for: Beta users, customer testing, feedback collection

**TestFlight Build Lifecycle:**

1. Upload build to App Store Connect
2. Build processes (10-30 minutes)
3. Add to internal testers (immediate) or external (requires review)
4. Testers download via TestFlight app
5. Builds expire after 90 days
6. Maximum 100 builds can be active at once

**Beta App Review:**

External testing builds are reviewed for:
- Crashes on launch
- Major bugs preventing testing
- Compliance with beta testing guidelines
- No incomplete or placeholder features in critical paths

Beta review is less strict than App Store review but still checks for basic functionality.
