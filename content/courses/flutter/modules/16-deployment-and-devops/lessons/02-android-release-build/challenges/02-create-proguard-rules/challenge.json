  "description": "Write ProGuard rules for a Flutter app using Firebase and Retrofit.",
  "instructions": "Create a proguard-rules.pro file that: 1) Keeps all Flutter framework classes, 2) Keeps Firebase and Google Play Services classes, 3) Keeps model classes in com.example.myapp.models package, 4) Preserves attributes needed for Retrofit/Gson JSON parsing.",

  "testCases": [],
  "hints": [
    {
      "level": 1,
      "text": "Use -keep class package.** { *; } to keep all classes in a package and its subpackages"

    {
      "level": 2,
      "text": "Use -keepattributes to preserve metadata needed for reflection"

      "level": 3,
      "text": "Use -dontwarn to suppress warnings for known-safe missing classes"

  "commonMistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Using single * instead of double **",
      "consequence": "Only matches classes in that exact package, not subpackages",
      "correction": "Use -keep class io.flutter.** { *; } with double asterisks"

    {
      "mistake": "Forgetting to keep model fields",
      "consequence": "JSON parsing fails because field names are obfuscated",
      "correction": "Keep the entire class with { *; } or use -keepclassmembers for fields"
