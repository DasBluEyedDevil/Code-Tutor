  "description": "Create a fly.toml configuration for a Serverpod backend with health checks and auto-scaling.",
  "instructions": "Complete the fly.toml configuration file for deploying a Serverpod backend to Fly.io. The configuration should:\n\n1. Set the app name to 'my-flutter-backend'\n2. Use 'sjc' (San Jose) as the primary region\n3. Configure the HTTP service on port 8080 with HTTPS enforcement\n4. Add a health check that hits '/health' every 15 seconds\n5. Configure auto-scaling with minimum 1 machine running\n6. Set VM resources to 1 shared CPU and 512MB memory",
  "language": "toml",
  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "hints": [
    "The app name must be globally unique on Fly.io - use lowercase and hyphens",
    "Health check interval is in milliseconds - 15 seconds = 15000ms",
    "For Serverpod, use the standard /health endpoint that returns a 200 OK response",
    "Use 'shared' cpu_kind for cost-effective deployments, 'dedicated' for production workloads"
