In this lesson, you learned:

✅ **ThemeData** defines your app's visual style in one place
✅ **ColorScheme.fromSeed()** generates a complete color palette from one seed color
✅ **Material 3** is the default in Flutter 3.16+ with 30+ coordinated colors
✅ **Light and dark themes** can be implemented with `theme` and `darkTheme`
✅ **TextTheme** provides predefined styles for different text purposes
✅ **Component themes** customize specific widgets (buttons, cards, inputs)
✅ **Theme.of(context)** accesses theme data anywhere in your widget tree
✅ Using theme colors ensures **consistency** across your entire app

**Key Takeaway:** Theming is essential for professional apps. Define your theme once, and every widget automatically follows your design system. Change your seed color, and your entire app updates instantly. This saves time, ensures consistency, and makes your app look polished!
