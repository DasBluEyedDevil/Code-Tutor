  "title": "Implement Content Moderation Service",
  "description": "Create a content moderation service that filters prohibited content and detects spam patterns.",
  "instructions": "Implement a ContentModerator class that:\n\n1. Checks content against a list of banned words\n2. Detects spam patterns (excessive caps, repeated characters, URLs)\n3. Returns a moderation result with reasons\n4. Supports configurable sensitivity levels\n5. Handles edge cases (Unicode, leetspeak)\n\nThe service should be fast enough for real-time moderation during post/comment creation.",

    {
      "mistake": "Only checking exact word matches for banned words",

      "mistake": "Blocking content synchronously in a slow moderation check",
      "consequence": "API becomes slow and unresponsive",
