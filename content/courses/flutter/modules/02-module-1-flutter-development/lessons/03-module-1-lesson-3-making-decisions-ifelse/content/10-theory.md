| Mistake | What Happens |
|---------|--------------|
| `if (age = 18)` instead of `if (age == 18)` | Syntax error or unexpected behavior |
| Forgetting `{ }` around code blocks | Only the first line is conditional |
| `if (age > 18 && < 30)` | Syntax error - need `age < 30` |
| Not covering all cases with else | Some inputs might not do anything |
| Checking conditions in wrong order | Wrong condition might match first |
