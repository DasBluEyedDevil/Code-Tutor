Now we can store information (variables) and make decisions (if/else). But what if we need to do something many times?

For example:
- Print numbers 1 through 100
- Process every item in a shopping cart
- Repeat a game until the player wants to quit

In the next lesson, we'll learn about **loops** - how to repeat actions without copying and pasting code!

See you there! 🚀
