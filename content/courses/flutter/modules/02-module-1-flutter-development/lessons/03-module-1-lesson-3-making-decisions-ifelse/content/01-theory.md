Programs need to make decisions like this all the time:
- If the password is correct, log the user in. Otherwise, show an error.
- If it's raining, bring an umbrella. Otherwise, leave it home.
- If the score is above 90, show an "A". Otherwise, show a different grade.

This is what **conditionals** do - they let your program choose different paths based on conditions.
