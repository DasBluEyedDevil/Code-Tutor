  "description": "Create a file called `age_advice.dart` that: 1. Has a variable `age` set to your age (or any age) 2. Uses if/else if/else to print different messages:    - If age < 13: \"You're a child! Enjoy playing!\"    - If age >= 13 and < 20: \"You're a teenager! Study hard!\"    - If age >= 20 and < 65: \"You're an adult! Work hard, but enjoy life!\"    - If age >= 65: \"You're a senior! Time to relax and enjoy retirement!\" --- ## Bonus Challenge: Grade Calculator Create a program that takes a score (0-100) and:   - 93-100: A   - 90-92: A-   - 87-89: B+   - And so on... This is tricky! You'll need nested conditions or multiple checks. ---",
