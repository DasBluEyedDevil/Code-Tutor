Dart 3 (released in 2023) introduced powerful new features that make your code cleaner, safer, and more expressive. In this lesson, you'll learn three game-changing features:

- **Records**: Group multiple values together without creating a class
- **Pattern Matching**: Destructure data and match complex conditions elegantly
- **Sealed Classes**: Create type-safe hierarchies with exhaustive switching

These features work together to make Dart feel more modern and reduce boilerplate code.
