**Question 1: B** - Anonymous record fields are accessed with `$1`, `$2`, etc. (1-indexed with $ prefix).

**Question 2: B** - The `when` keyword adds a guard condition that must be true for the pattern to match.

**Question 3: B** - Sealed classes can only be extended in the same library, enabling the compiler to ensure switch statements handle all cases.

**Question 4: C** - Named record fields are destructured with `:name` syntax, which creates a variable with the same name as the field.
