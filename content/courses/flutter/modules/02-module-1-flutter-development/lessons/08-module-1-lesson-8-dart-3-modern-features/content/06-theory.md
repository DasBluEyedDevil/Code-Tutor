### What Is Pattern Matching?

**Conceptual First:**
Imagine opening a gift box. Instead of saying "get the box, then look inside, then check what's there," you just say "if it's a book, read it; if it's a toy, play with it."

**Pattern matching** lets you inspect data structure and extract values in one elegant step. It's like X-ray vision for your data!

**Jargon:**
- **Destructuring**: Breaking apart a data structure into its components
- **Pattern**: A template that data is matched against
- **Guard clause**: An additional condition with `when`
