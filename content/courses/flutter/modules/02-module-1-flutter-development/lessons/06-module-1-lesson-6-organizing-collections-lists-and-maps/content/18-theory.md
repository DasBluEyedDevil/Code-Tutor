You've now learned all the **fundamental building blocks** of programming:
- ✅ Variables (storing data)
- ✅ Conditionals (making decisions)
- ✅ Loops (repeating actions)
- ✅ Functions (organizing code)
- ✅ Lists and Maps (managing collections)

In the next lessons, we'll do a **mini-project** to put it all together, and then we'll move into **Flutter** and start building actual user interfaces!

Get ready to build something cool! 🚀
