Let's recap:
- ✅ Loops let us repeat code without copy-pasting
- ✅ `for` loops are for known repetitions
- ✅ `while` loops run until a condition is false
- ✅ `i++` increments, `i--` decrements
- ✅ `break` exits a loop early
- ✅ `continue` skips to the next iteration
- ✅ Nested loops create patterns and grids
