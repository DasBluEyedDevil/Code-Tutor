title: "The \"for\" Loop - Counting Repetitions"
---


When you know **exactly how many times** to repeat something, use a `for` loop.

**Conceptual Explanation**:
Think of it like counting:
- **Start** at 1
- **Keep going** while less than or equal to 5
- **Count up** by 1 each time

**The Pattern**:


**Real Example**:


**Output**:



```dart
This is repetition number 1
This is repetition number 2
This is repetition number 3
```
