Imagine your parent tells you: "Wash all 10 dishes in the sink."

You wouldn't write:

You'd think: "**Repeat** washing until all dishes are done."

That's exactly what **loops** do in programming - they repeat actions without you having to write the same code over and over.



```dart
Wash dish 1
Wash dish 2
Wash dish 3
Wash dish 4
Wash dish 5
Wash dish 6
Wash dish 7
Wash dish 8
Wash dish 9
Wash dish 10
```
