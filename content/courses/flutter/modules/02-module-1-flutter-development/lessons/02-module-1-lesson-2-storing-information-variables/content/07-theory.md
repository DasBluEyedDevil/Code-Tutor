You can't just name variables anything you want. There are rules:

**✅ Valid Names**:

**❌ Invalid Names**:

**Naming Convention (Best Practice)**:
- Use camelCase: `firstName`, `myAge`, `isLoggedIn`
- First word lowercase, subsequent words capitalized
- Be descriptive: `userName` is better than `un`



```dart
var 2age = 25;           // Can't start with a number
var first-name = 'Alex'; // Can't use hyphens
var my age = 25;         // Can't have spaces
var class = 'Math';      // 'class' is a reserved word
```
