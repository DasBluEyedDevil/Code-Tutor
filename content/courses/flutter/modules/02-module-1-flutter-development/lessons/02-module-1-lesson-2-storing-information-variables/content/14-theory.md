Now we can store information. But what if we want our program to make decisions?

"If the user is logged in, show the dashboard. Otherwise, show the login page."

"If the age is under 18, show 'You're a minor'. Otherwise, show 'You're an adult'."

In the next lesson, we'll learn about **conditionals** (if/else statements) - how to make your program smart enough to make decisions!

See you there! 🚀
