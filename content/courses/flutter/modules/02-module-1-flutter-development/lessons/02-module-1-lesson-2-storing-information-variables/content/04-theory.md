Just like in real life, we need different types of containers for different things. You wouldn't store milk in a cardboard box!

In Dart, variables have **types**:

### 1. Text (Strings)

For storing words and sentences:


### 2. Numbers (Integers)

For storing whole numbers:


### 3. Decimal Numbers (Doubles)

For storing numbers with decimals:


### 4. True/False (Booleans)

For storing yes/no, true/false values:




```dart
var isLoggedIn = true;
var hasNewMessages = false;
var isWeekend = true;
```
