The basic syntax is:


Let's break this down:

**Conceptual Explanation**:
- We're creating a box
- The box is labeled `name`
- We're putting the text `'Sarah'` inside it

**Technical Terms**:
- `var`: This keyword tells Dart "I'm about to create a variable"
- `name`: This is the variable name (the label on the box)
- `=`: This is the assignment operator (putting something in the box)
- `'Sarah'`: This is the value (the contents of the box)



```dart
var name = 'Sarah';
```
