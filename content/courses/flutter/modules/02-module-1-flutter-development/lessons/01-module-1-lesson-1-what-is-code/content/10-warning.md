**Common Pitfalls When Starting Out:**

1. **Case sensitivity matters**
   - `main` is NOT the same as `Main` or `MAIN`
   - `print` is NOT the same as `Print`

2. **Quotes must match**
   - ✅ `'Hello'` or `"Hello"` (both work)
   - ❌ `'Hello"` (mismatched = error!)

3. **Single vs Double quotes in Dart**
   - Both work! Dart treats `'text'` and `"text"` the same
   - Use double quotes when your text has an apostrophe: `"I'm learning"`

4. **Every opening brace needs a closing brace**
   - `{` must have a matching `}`
   - `(` must have a matching `)`

5. **The terminal shows your output**
   - Look at the bottom panel in VS Code to see `print()` results
