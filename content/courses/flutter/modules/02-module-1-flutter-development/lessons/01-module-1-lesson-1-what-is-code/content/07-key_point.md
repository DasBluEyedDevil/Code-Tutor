**Don't memorize syntax. Understand concepts.**

You might forget whether to use `print()` or `display()`. That's okay! You can always look it up.

What matters is understanding:
- Programs run instructions in order
- You need a starting point (`main`)
- You can tell the computer to display text

The exact spelling and punctuation will become natural with practice.
