Let's understand what each part does, *in plain English first*:


Think of this like a play with actors on a stage:

1. **The stage**: `main()` is the main stage where your program starts. Every Dart program must have a `main()`. It's the starting point.

2. **The action**: Inside the curly braces `{ }` is what happens on that stage.

3. **The dialogue**: `print('Hello, World!');` is like an actor saying a line. It displays text.



```dart
void main() {
  print('Hello, World!');
}
```
