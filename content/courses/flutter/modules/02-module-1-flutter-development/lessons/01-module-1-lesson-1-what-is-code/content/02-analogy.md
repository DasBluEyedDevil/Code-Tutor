Imagine you're teaching a robot to make a sandwich. The robot is very literal - it only does *exactly* what you tell it to do.

You can't just say "make me a sandwich." You need to give step-by-step instructions:


**This is what code is**: A series of precise instructions that a computer follows, step by step.



```dart
1. Get two slices of bread
2. Open the peanut butter jar
3. Spread peanut butter on one slice
4. Open the jelly jar
5. Spread jelly on the other slice
6. Put the two slices together
7. Close both jars
```
