Flutter can run your app in multiple places:

### 1. **Web Browser (Chrome/Edge/Safari)**
- **Best for**: Quick testing, beginners
- **Speed**: Fastest to start
- **Limitations**: Can't test phone-specific features (camera, GPS, etc.)

### 2. **Desktop (Windows/Mac/Linux)**
- **Best for**: Apps that work on computers too
- **Speed**: Very fast
- **Limitations**: Different screen sizes and interactions than phones

### 3. **Emulator/Simulator**
- **Best for**: Testing on virtual phones without owning one
- **Speed**: Slower to start (2-5 minutes first time)
- **Limitations**: Uses more computer resources (RAM, CPU)

### 4. **Physical Device**
- **Best for**: Final testing, real-world performance
- **Speed**: Fast once connected
- **Limitations**: Requires a real phone and USB cable
