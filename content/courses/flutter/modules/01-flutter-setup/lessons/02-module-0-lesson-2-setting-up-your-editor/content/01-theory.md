Think of writing code like writing a book. You *could* use Notepad or TextEdit, but professional writers use Microsoft Word or Google Docs because they have spell-check, grammar suggestions, and formatting tools.

For programming, we use a special kind of text editor called an **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment) or **code editor**. These tools:
- Highlight your code with colors (making it easier to read)
- Catch mistakes as you type (like spell-check)
- Auto-complete your code (like text predictions on your phone)
- Let you run and test your app with one click
