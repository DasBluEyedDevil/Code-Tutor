### Step 1: Download VS Code

1. Go to: `https://code.visualstudio.com`
2. Click the big download button (it auto-detects your operating system)
3. Install it like any other program:
   - **Windows**: Run the `.exe` file
   - **Mac**: Drag the `.app` to your Applications folder
   - **Linux**: Follow the instructions for your distribution

### Step 2: Install the Flutter Extension

Once VS Code is installed:

1. **Open VS Code**
2. Click the **Extensions** icon on the left sidebar (it looks like four squares)
3. In the search bar, type: `Flutter`
4. Find the extension called **"Flutter"** by Dart Code
5. Click **Install**

This will automatically install two extensions:
- **Flutter**: Adds Flutter-specific features
- **Dart**: Adds support for the Dart language
