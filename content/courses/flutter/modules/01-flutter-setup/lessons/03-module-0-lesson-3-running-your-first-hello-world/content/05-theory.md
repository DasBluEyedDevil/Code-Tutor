### Step 1: Choose a Device

At the bottom-right of VS Code, you should see a device selector. Click it and choose one of:
- **Chrome** (easiest for beginners - runs in a web browser)
- **Windows** / **macOS** / **Linux** (if available)
- **Android Emulator** (if you have one set up)
- **iOS Simulator** (Mac only, if set up)

For this lesson, **choose Chrome** - it's the simplest option.

### Step 2: Run the App

There are three ways to run your app:

**Option 1**: Press `F5`

**Option 2**: Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`, type "Flutter: Run", press Enter

**Option 3**: Click the "Run" button in the top-right corner

Choose any method. You'll see:
1. A terminal opens at the bottom
2. Text scrolling by (this is Flutter building your app)
3. After 10-30 seconds, a window opens showing your app!
