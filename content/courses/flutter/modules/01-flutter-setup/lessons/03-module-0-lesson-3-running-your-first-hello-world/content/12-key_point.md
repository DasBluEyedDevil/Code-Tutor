- Create a new Flutter project using `Flutter: New Project` from VS Code's command palette or `flutter create` in the terminal
- `main()` is the entry point of every Flutter app; `runApp()` launches the widget tree on screen
- Hot reload (`Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S`) applies code changes instantly without losing app state -- use it for rapid iteration
- The default counter app confirms your SDK, editor, and device/emulator are all working correctly
- Run `flutter doctor` whenever something breaks to diagnose missing dependencies or configuration issues
