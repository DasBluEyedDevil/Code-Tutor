If widgets were tools, `Container` would be a Swiss Army knife - it does MANY things:
- Acts as a **box** to hold other widgets
- Adds **padding** (breathing room inside)
- Adds **margin** (spacing outside)
- Sets **background color**
- Adds **borders**
- Makes **rounded corners**
- Sets **width and height**

**Container is the most versatile widget you'll use!**
