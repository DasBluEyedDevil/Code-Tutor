type: "THEORY"

Dart 3.10 introduced a cleaner way to write enum values. When the type is known from context, you can omit the enum name.

**Why this matters:**
- Less typing
- Cleaner code
- Easier to read and refactor
- The analyzer knows the type so you don't need to repeat it

This is a modern Dart feature that makes Flutter code significantly more readable!
