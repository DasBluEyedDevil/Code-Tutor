**Use shorthands when:**
- The parameter type makes context obvious
- You want cleaner, more readable code
- Working on new Dart 3.10+ projects

**Use verbose form when:**
- Reading older code from StackOverflow (it may use verbose syntax)
- Working on projects with older Dart SDK versions
- Teaching someone new (explicit is clearer for learning)

**Both styles are valid!** Flutter accepts either syntax. Use whatever makes your code most readable for your situation.
