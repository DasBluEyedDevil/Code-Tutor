Let's make changes to see how widgets work!

### Change 1: Bigger Text


Save and see the text get bigger!

### Change 2: Add Color


The text is now blue!

### Change 3: Multiple Style Properties


Now it's big, blue, and bold!



```dart
Text(
  'Hello, Flutter!',
  style: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 48,
    color: Colors.blue,
    fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
  ),
),
```
