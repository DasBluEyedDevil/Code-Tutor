Right now, we can display text. But real apps need layouts - multiple pieces of content arranged on screen.

- How to stack things vertically (like a to-do list)
- How to arrange things horizontally (like a row of buttons)
- How to create complex arrangements

Get ready to build real app screens! 🚀
