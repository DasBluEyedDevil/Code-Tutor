Remember playing with LEGO bricks? Each brick is a simple piece, but when you combine them, you can build amazing things - houses, cars, spaceships!

**Flutter widgets work exactly the same way!**
- Each widget is a building block
- You snap widgets together
- Complex UIs are made from simple widgets combined
