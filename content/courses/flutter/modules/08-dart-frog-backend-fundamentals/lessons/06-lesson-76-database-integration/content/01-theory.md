When building a Dart Frog backend, you have several database options:

**1. PostgreSQL** (with `postgres` package)
- Industry-standard relational database
- Powerful querying with SQL
- Great for structured data with relationships
- Used by: Instagram, Spotify, Netflix

**2. SQLite** (with `sqlite3` package)
- Lightweight, file-based database
- Perfect for development and small apps
- No separate server required
- Easy to set up and test

**3. Firebase/Supabase**
- Cloud-hosted, managed databases
- Real-time sync capabilities
- No database administration needed

**4. MongoDB** (with `mongo_dart` package)
- Document-oriented (NoSQL)
- Flexible schema
- Great for unstructured data

**In This Lesson**: We focus on PostgreSQL basics because it's the most common choice for production backends and teaches fundamental database concepts you can apply anywhere.
