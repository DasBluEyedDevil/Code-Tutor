### Module 8 Complete!

You now have production-ready backend development skills:

**1. RESTful API Design**
- Proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Meaningful status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 405)
- JSON request/response handling
- Resource-based URLs (/notes, /notes/:id)

**2. JWT Authentication**
- Token creation and signing
- Token verification and expiration
- Protected routes with middleware
- Stateless authentication

**3. Middleware Architecture**
- Global middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Route-specific middleware for auth
- Request context and dependency injection

**4. Separation of Concerns**
- Models for data structure
- Services for business logic
- Routes for HTTP handling
- Utils for reusable helpers

**5. Security Best Practices**
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Parameterized queries (SQL injection prevention)
- Authorization checks (users can only access their own notes)
- Input validation

### Next Steps

**Ready to Deploy?**
- Use `dart_frog build` for production build
- Deploy to Railway, Fly.io, or Google Cloud Run
- Add PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Add environment variables for secrets

**Module 9 Coming Up**: Serverpod -- a batteries-included Dart backend framework for production applications!
