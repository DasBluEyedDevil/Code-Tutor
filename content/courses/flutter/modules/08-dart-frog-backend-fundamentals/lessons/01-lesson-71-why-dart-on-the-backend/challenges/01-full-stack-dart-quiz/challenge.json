  "description": "Test your understanding of full-stack Dart benefits and when to use Dart backends.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "text": "What is the PRIMARY advantage of using Dart for both frontend and backend?",
      "options": [
        "Dart runs faster than all other languages",
        "You can share code (like models) between Flutter and the server",
        "Flutter requires a Dart backend",
        "Other backend languages don't support REST APIs"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The main advantage is code sharing. When you use Dart on both ends, you can write model classes once and use them everywhere. This reduces duplication and bugs from mismatched definitions."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "text": "Which framework is described as 'Next.js for Dart' with file-based routing?",
      "options": [
        "Shelf",
        "Serverpod",
        "Dart Frog",
        "Flutter Server"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Dart Frog uses file-based routing (create a file, get a route) similar to Next.js. It's lightweight and perfect for learning and prototypes."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "text": "When might you choose a NON-Dart backend?",
      "options": [
        "When building a Flutter app",
        "When you want shared models",
        "When your existing team uses Python and has ML expertise",
        "When you want fast development"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "If your team already has expertise in another language (like Python for ML), forcing Dart might cause friction. Technology choices should consider team skills and ecosystem needs."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "text": "What does Shelf provide in the Dart ecosystem?",
      "options": [
        "A full ORM and authentication system",
        "The low-level HTTP server foundation",
        "File-based routing",
        "A Flutter widget library"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Shelf is the low-level HTTP server library for Dart. It's the foundation that frameworks like Dart Frog build upon. It gives you complete control but requires more manual work."
