**Dart Backend is GREAT for:**

- **Flutter Apps**: Obvious synergy - same language, shared code
- **Rapid Prototypes**: Get a backend running in minutes
- **Full-Stack Dart Teams**: Everyone speaks the same language
- **Learning Backend Concepts**: Familiar syntax, focus on concepts
- **Small-to-Medium APIs**: Dart Frog handles these beautifully

**Consider Alternatives When:**

- **Existing Non-Dart Team**: If your backend team lives in Python/Node/Go, forcing Dart may cause friction
- **Specific Ecosystem Needs**: Python for ML/AI, Node.js for certain libraries, Go for extreme performance
- **Legacy System Integration**: Sometimes matching existing tech is more practical
- **Hiring Constraints**: Dart backend developers are less common than Node/Python developers

**Reality Check**: Dart backends are production-ready and used by real companies. But technology choices involve trade-offs. The right choice depends on your team, timeline, and requirements.

**For this course**: We're building Flutter apps with Dart backends. This is the ideal learning path for Flutter developers wanting full-stack capabilities.
