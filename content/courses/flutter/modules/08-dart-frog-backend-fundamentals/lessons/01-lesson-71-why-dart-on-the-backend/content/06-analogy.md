Imagine a restaurant where the kitchen staff and the waiters speak different languages. Every order has to go through a translator, which slows everything down and introduces mistakes. That is what happens when your frontend is written in one language (Dart/Flutter) and your backend in another (Node.js, Python, Go).

Now imagine a restaurant where everyone speaks the same language. The chef can read the waiter's notes directly, and when a new menu item is added, both teams understand it immediately. **Dart on the backend is like giving your entire restaurant one shared language.** Your data models, validation logic, and type definitions work identically on both sides of the kitchen door.

The practical payoff is real: one language to learn, one set of tools to maintain, and shared code between your Flutter app and your server. When you change a data model, the Dart compiler catches mismatches on both sides before anything reaches a customer.
