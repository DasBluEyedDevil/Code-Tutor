  "description": "Enhance the navigation experience with custom page transitions for different route types.",
  "instructions": "Create a custom page builder that applies different animations based on route type:\n\n1. Fade transition for auth screens (login, register)\n2. Slide from right for forward navigation within the app\n3. Slide from bottom for modal-style screens (settings, profile edit)\n4. No animation for redirect navigations\n\nUse GoRouter's pageBuilder to apply these transitions.",
