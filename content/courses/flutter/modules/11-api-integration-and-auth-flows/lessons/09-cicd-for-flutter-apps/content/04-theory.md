4. ✅ Green checkmark = all passed
5. ❌ Red X = something failed

### Advanced: Multi-Platform CI

Test on Linux, macOS, and Windows:




```yaml
name: Flutter CI (Multi-Platform)

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Test on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.24.0'
          channel: 'stable'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: flutter pub get

      - name: Run tests
        run: flutter test

      - name: Build
        run: |
          if [ "$RUNNER_OS" == "Linux" ]; then
            flutter build apk --debug
          elif [ "$RUNNER_OS" == "macOS" ]; then
            flutter build ios --no-codesign
          elif [ "$RUNNER_OS" == "Windows" ]; then
            flutter build windows
          fi
        shell: bash
```
