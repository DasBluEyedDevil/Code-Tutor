Just like in real life, we need different types of containers for different things. You wouldn't store milk in a cardboard box!

In Dart, variables have **types**:

### 1. Text (Strings)

For storing words and sentences:

```dart
var name = 'Alex';
var message = 'Hello, World!';
var fullSentence = 'Welcome to Flutter development';
```

### 2. Numbers (Integers)

For storing whole numbers:

```dart
var age = 28;
var score = 100;
var year = 2024;
```

### 3. Decimal Numbers (Doubles)

For storing numbers with decimals:

```dart
var price = 19.99;
var temperature = 72.5;
var pi = 3.14159;
```

### 4. True/False (Booleans)

For storing yes/no, true/false values:




```dart
var isLoggedIn = true;
var hasNewMessages = false;
var isWeekend = true;
```
