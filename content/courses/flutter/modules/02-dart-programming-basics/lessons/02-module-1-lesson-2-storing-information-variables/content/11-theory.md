| Mistake | What Happens |
|---------|--------------|
| `var Name = 'Alex';` | Works, but should be `name` (lowercase first letter) |
| `name = 'Alex';` without `var` first | Error: Variable not declared |
| `var age = '25';` then trying to do math | Wrong! '25' is text, not a number |
| `var age = 25; var age = 30;` | Error: Variable already declared |
| Using a variable before creating it | Error: Undefined name |
