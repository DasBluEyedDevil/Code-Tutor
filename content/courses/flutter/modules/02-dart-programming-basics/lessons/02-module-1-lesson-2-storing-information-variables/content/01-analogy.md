Imagine you're organizing your room. You have different boxes:
- A box labeled "TOYS" containing your toys
- A box labeled "BOOKS" containing your books
- A box labeled "CLOTHES" containing your clothes

Each box has:
1. A **label** (so you know what's inside)
2. **Contents** (the actual stuff)

In programming, we call these boxes **variables**. They let us store information and give it a name so we can use it later.
