- Build incrementally: start with hardcoded values, then add randomness, then add user input -- each version builds on the last
- `Random().nextInt(max)` generates a random integer from 0 to max-1; add 1 to get a 1-to-max range
- `while` loops keep the game running until a condition (correct guess) is met -- always include an exit condition
- Combine variables, conditionals, loops, and functions in one project to see how Dart fundamentals work together
- Validate user input before using it (check for null, empty strings, and non-numeric values) to prevent crashes
