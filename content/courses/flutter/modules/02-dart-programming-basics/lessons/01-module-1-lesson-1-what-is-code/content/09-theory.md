Here are mistakes everyone makes at first:

| Mistake | What Happens |
|---------|--------------|
| Forgetting `;` | Error: "Expected ';'" |
| Mismatched quotes `'Hello"` | Error: "Unexpected character" |
| Forgetting `()` after `main` | Error: "Expected '('" |
| Typing `Main` instead of `main` | Error: "Expected 'main'" |
| Forgetting closing `}` | Error: "Expected '}'" |

**These are normal!** Every programmer makes these mistakes. The computer will always tell you exactly what's wrong.
