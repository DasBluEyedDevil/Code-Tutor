Now that you understand the *concept*, here are the official programming terms:

- **`void`**: This means "doesn't give back any information." Don't worry about this yet.

- **`main()`**: This is called a **function**. It's a container for instructions. The `main` function is special - it's where every program begins.

- **`{ }`**: These curly braces define the **body** of the function. Everything inside them is part of `main`.

- **`print()`**: This is also a function, but one that's already built into Dart. It displays text in the terminal.

- **`'Hello, World!'`**: This is a **string** - programmer-speak for "text." Strings always go in quotes.

- **`;`**: The semicolon tells Dart "this instruction is complete." It's like a period at the end of a sentence.
