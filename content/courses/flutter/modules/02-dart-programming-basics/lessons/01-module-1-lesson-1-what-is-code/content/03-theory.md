When you write code, you're writing instructions for a computer. The computer:
- Reads your instructions from top to bottom (usually)
- Executes them exactly as written
- Doesn't make assumptions or "guess" what you meant
- Will do exactly what you say, even if it's wrong!

This is both powerful and dangerous:
- **Powerful**: You have complete control
- **Dangerous**: Small mistakes (like forgetting a step) cause errors
