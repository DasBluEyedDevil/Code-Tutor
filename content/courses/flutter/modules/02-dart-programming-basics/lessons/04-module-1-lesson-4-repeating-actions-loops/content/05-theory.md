### Counting Down


**Output**:

**Note**: `i--` means "subtract 1" (shorthand for `i = i - 1`)

### Counting by 2s


**Output**:

**Note**: `i += 2` means "add 2" (shorthand for `i = i + 2`)

### Starting from Any Number




```dart
void main() {
  for (var age = 18; age <= 21; age++) {
    print('At age $age, you can...');
  }
}
```
