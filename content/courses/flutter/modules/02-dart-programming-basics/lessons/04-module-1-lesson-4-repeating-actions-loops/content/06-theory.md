title: "The \"while\" Loop - Repeat Until..."
---


When you **don't know how many times** you'll repeat, but you know **when to stop**, use a `while` loop.

**Conceptual Explanation**:
Think of it like: "**While** it's raining, stay inside."
- You don't know how long it will rain
- But you know the condition to check

**The Pattern**:


**Real Example**:


**Output**:

**⚠️ Warning**: If you forget `count++`, the loop runs FOREVER (infinite loop)!



```dart
Count is 1
Count is 2
Count is 3
Count is 4
Count is 5
```
