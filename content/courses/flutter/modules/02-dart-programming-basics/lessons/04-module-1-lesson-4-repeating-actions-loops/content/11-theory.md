| Mistake | What Happens |
|---------|--------------|
| Forgetting `i++` in while loop | Infinite loop! |
| Using `=` instead of `==` in condition | Always true or syntax error |
| Starting at wrong number | Loop runs wrong number of times |
| Off-by-one error (`< 5` vs `<= 5`) | Loop runs one too few or too many times |
| Forgetting `var` before `i` | Error: i not defined |
