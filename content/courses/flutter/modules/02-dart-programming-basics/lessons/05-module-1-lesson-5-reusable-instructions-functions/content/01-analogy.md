Imagine you love making peanut butter sandwiches. Instead of remembering all the steps every time, you have a recipe card:


Now, whenever you want a sandwich, you just say "Make PB&J Sandwich" and follow the recipe!

**Functions are exactly like this** - they're named sets of instructions you can use over and over.



```dart
Recipe: Make PB&J Sandwich
1. Get two slices of bread
2. Spread peanut butter on one slice
3. Spread jelly on the other slice
4. Put the slices together
5. Cut in half
```
