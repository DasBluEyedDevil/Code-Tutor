Now we can:
- Store data (variables)
- Make decisions (if/else)
- Repeat actions (loops)
- Organize code (functions)

But what if we need to store **multiple related items**? Like a shopping list with many items?

In the next lesson, we'll learn about **Lists and Maps** - how to organize collections of data!

See you there! 🚀
