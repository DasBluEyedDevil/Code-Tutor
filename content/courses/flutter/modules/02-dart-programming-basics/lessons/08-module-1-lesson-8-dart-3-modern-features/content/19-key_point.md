In this lesson, you learned Dart 3's modern features:

**Records:**
- Create lightweight, immutable data groupings
- Access positional fields with `$1`, `$2`
- Access named fields by name
- Perfect for returning multiple values from functions

**Pattern Matching:**
- Destructure records, lists, and maps elegantly
- Use `switch` expressions with pattern cases
- Add guard clauses with `when`
- Use `if-case` for conditional matching

**Sealed Classes:**
- Define closed type hierarchies
- Enable exhaustive switch statements
- Perfect for state management
- Compiler catches missing cases

These features work together to make your Dart code cleaner, safer, and more expressive!
