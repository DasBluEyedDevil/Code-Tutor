**Conceptual Explanation**:
Think of a dictionary - you look up a **word** (key) to find its **meaning** (value).

Maps work the same way: they store **key-value pairs**.

**Real-world example**: A phone book
- **Key**: Person's name
- **Value**: Phone number




```dart
"Alice" → "555-1234"
"Bob"   → "555-5678"
"Carol" → "555-9012"
```
