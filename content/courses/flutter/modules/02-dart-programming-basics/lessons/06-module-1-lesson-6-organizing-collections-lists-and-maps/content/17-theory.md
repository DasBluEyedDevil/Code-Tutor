Let's recap:
- ✅ Lists store multiple items in order
- ✅ Lists use zero-based indexing [0, 1, 2...]
- ✅ Use `add()`, `remove()`, `length` with Lists
- ✅ Maps store key-value pairs
- ✅ Use keys to access values: `map[key]`
- ✅ Loop through both Lists and Maps
- ✅ Type your collections: `List<String>`, `Map<String, int>`
