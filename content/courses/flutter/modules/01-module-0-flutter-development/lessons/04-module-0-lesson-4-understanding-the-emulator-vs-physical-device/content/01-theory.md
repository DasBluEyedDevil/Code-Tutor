You've installed Flutter and created your first app. But where does it actually run? You have several options, and each has its purpose.

Think of it like testing a new board game:
- **Playing solo at home** = Running on your computer (easiest, fastest)
- **Playing on a practice board** = Using an emulator (simulates a real phone)
- **Playing the actual game** = Using a real phone (most accurate)
