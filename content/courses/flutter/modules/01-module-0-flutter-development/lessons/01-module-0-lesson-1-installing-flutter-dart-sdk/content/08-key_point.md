Throughout this course, we use phrases like "latest stable" instead of specific version numbers. This keeps the course current as Flutter evolves.

**To find current recommended versions:**
See `CURRENT_VERSIONS.md` in the course materials.

**Quick Check - Your Installed Versions:**
```bash
flutter --version
```

**General Rule:** Use the latest stable Flutter SDK. The course is tested with Flutter 3.38+ and Dart 3.10+, but newer versions should work fine.
