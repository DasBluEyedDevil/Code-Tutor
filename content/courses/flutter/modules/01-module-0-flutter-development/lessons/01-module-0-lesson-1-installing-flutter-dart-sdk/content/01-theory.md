Imagine you want to build a treehouse. Before you start nailing boards together, you need tools: a hammer, nails, wood, a saw. You can't build anything without your tools ready.

Building phone apps is the same. Before we write a single line of code, we need to install our "toolbox" on your computer. This toolbox contains everything we need to:
- Write instructions for your app (the code)
- Turn those instructions into something a phone can understand
- Test your app on a fake phone on your computer (before putting it on a real phone)

**The Big Picture**: Right now, your computer doesn't know how to build phone apps. We're going to teach it. Once we're done with this lesson, your computer will be ready to build apps for Android phones, iPhones, and even websites—all from the same code.
