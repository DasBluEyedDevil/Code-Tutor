### **FOR WINDOWS USERS:**

**Step 1: Download Flutter**
1. Open your web browser and go to: `https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows`
2. Click the blue "Download Flutter SDK" button
3. A file called something like `flutter_windows_3.x.x-stable.zip` will download

**Step 2: Extract the Files**
1. Once downloaded, find the ZIP file (probably in your Downloads folder)
2. Right-click on it → Choose "Extract All"
3. Extract it to a simple location like `C:\src\flutter`
   - ⚠️ **Important**: Do NOT put it in a folder like `C:\Program Files`

**Step 3: Add Flutter to Your PATH**

*What's PATH? It's like your computer's phonebook. When you type "flutter" in a terminal, your computer looks through its PATH to find where the flutter program lives. We're adding Flutter's location to that phonebook.*

Open PowerShell (search for "PowerShell" in the Start menu) and run:


**Step 4: Verify Installation**

Close and reopen PowerShell, then run:




```powershell
flutter doctor
```
