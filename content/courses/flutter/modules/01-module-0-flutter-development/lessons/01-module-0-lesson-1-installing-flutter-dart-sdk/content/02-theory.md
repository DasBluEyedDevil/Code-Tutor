The toolbox we're installing has two main parts:

1. **Flutter**: This is the main toolkit. It's like the instruction manual and the assembly line for building apps. Flutter was created by Google and lets you build apps for phones, tablets, computers, and websites—all at once.

2. **Dart SDK**: SDK stands for "Software Development Kit" (don't worry about memorizing that). Dart is the *language* we'll use to write our instructions. Think of it like this: if Flutter is the kitchen, Dart is the language of the recipes.

When we "install Flutter," we're actually getting both Flutter and Dart together. They're best friends and always come as a package.
