In the next module, we're going to slow down and learn the Dart programming language from scratch. We'll start with the absolute basics:
- How to store information (variables)
- How to make decisions (if/else)
- How to repeat actions (loops)

All taught interactively, with lots of practice!

See you in Module 1! 🚀
