In programming, "Hello World" is a tradition. It's the simplest possible program that just displays the text "Hello World" on the screen. It's used to verify that:
- Your tools are installed correctly
- You can create a new project
- You can run code
- You can see the result

Once you see "Hello World" running, you'll know your development environment is ready for real work!
