For Flutter development, we recommend **Visual Studio Code** (VS Code for short). Don't confuse this with "Visual Studio" - they're different programs!

**Why VS Code?**
- It's **free** and works on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- It's **lightweight** (doesn't slow down your computer)
- It has **amazing Flutter support** through extensions
- It's what most Flutter developers use
