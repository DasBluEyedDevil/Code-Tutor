**Understanding Your Users**

You've built a feature you're proud of. But is anyone using it? Are they using it the way you expected? Analytics answers these questions with data, not guesses.

**What Analytics Can Tell You**

1. **Usage Patterns** - Which features are popular? Which are ignored?
2. **User Journeys** - How do users navigate through your app?
3. **Conversion Funnels** - Where do users drop off in key flows?
4. **Retention** - Are users coming back? How often?
5. **Engagement** - How long do users spend in your app?

**The Build-Measure-Learn Cycle**

Analytics is essential for product iteration:

```
Build Feature → Measure Usage → Learn from Data → Build Better Feature
```

Without measurement, you're guessing. With analytics, you're making informed decisions.

**Privacy Considerations**

With great data comes great responsibility:

- **Transparency** - Tell users what you collect in your privacy policy
- **Minimization** - Only collect data you actually need
- **Anonymization** - Avoid personally identifiable information when possible
- **Compliance** - GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations may apply
- **Consent** - Some jurisdictions require explicit opt-in for analytics

**What NOT to Track**

- Personal health or financial data
- Precise location (unless essential to your app)
- Passwords or sensitive credentials
- Private messages or personal content
- Anything that could identify or embarrass users
