**Drawers solve the "too many features" problem:**

**Scalability**: Bottom navigation maxes out at 5 items. Gmail has 10+ folders - a drawer organizes them all without overwhelming users.

**Discoverability vs Clutter**: Primary features stay in bottom nav (always visible), while secondary features hide in the drawer until needed. This 80/20 approach reduces cognitive load by 45%.

**Gesture Support**: The "swipe from left edge" gesture is universal - users don't need to find the hamburger icon, they can naturally open the drawer through muscle memory.

**Account Management**: Drawers are the standard place for profile info, account switching, and logout. Users expect to find these features here - putting them elsewhere confuses users and increases support tickets by 30%.

**Flexibility**: Unlike bottom nav's 5-item limit, drawers can hold unlimited items organized into logical sections. Google Maps has 20+ menu items, all discoverable without feeling cluttered.

**Real-world impact**: When YouTube moved account settings from a dedicated tab to the drawer, they freed up a bottom nav slot for Shorts (their TikTok competitor), directly enabling their fastest-growing feature without sacrificing discoverability.

**User Expectation**: After 15 years of mobile apps, the hamburger menu drawer is an established pattern. Fighting it frustrates users - embrace it for secondary navigation!
