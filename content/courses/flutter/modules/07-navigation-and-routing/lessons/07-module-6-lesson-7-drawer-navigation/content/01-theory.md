title: "The Hidden Menu Pattern"
---


You've seen this pattern everywhere:
- **Gmail**: Tap hamburger icon → Drawer slides in with all folders
- **Google Maps**: Menu shows Settings, Your places, Offline maps
- **Spotify**: Library, Playlists, Settings hidden in drawer

**Think of a drawer like a filing cabinet drawer** - hidden until you need it, then slides open to reveal organized content!

**When to use drawers:**
- Secondary navigation (not primary destinations)
- Settings and account options
- Overflow content that doesn't fit in bottom navigation
- Apps with many features (10+ destinations)
