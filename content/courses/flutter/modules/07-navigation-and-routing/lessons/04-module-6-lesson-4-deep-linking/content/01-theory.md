title: "What is Deep Linking?"
---


Imagine receiving an email: "Check out this product!" with a link. You tap it and:
- ❌ **Without deep linking**: Opens browser → App store → Download app → Open app → Search for product
- ✅ **With deep linking**: Opens app directly to that product!

**Deep linking** = Direct shortcuts to specific content in your app.

**Real-world examples:**
- Instagram post link → Opens Instagram app to that post
- Amazon product link → Opens Amazon app to product page
- YouTube video link → Opens YouTube app playing that video
