1. **B** - DefaultTabController manages tab state automatically, eliminating the need to manually create and dispose a TabController
2. **B** - Use `isScrollable: true` when you have more than 4-5 tabs or when tab labels are long, allowing horizontal scrolling
3. **C** - AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin with `wantKeepAlive = true` preserves widget state (like scroll position) when switching between tabs
