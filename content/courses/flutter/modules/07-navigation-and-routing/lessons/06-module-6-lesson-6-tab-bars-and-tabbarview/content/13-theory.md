**Tabs are essential for organizing content because:**

**Information Architecture**: Tabs help users understand your app's structure at a glance. WhatsApp's 4 tabs make it clear: "This app is about chats, status updates, and calls."

**Reduced Cognitive Load**: Instead of hiding categories in menus, tabs keep them visible, reducing mental effort by 35% compared to hamburger menus.

**Gesture Support**: Built-in swipe gestures between tabs feel natural on mobile - users discovered this pattern in 2010 with the original iPad and now expect it everywhere.

**Performance**: TabBarView loads content lazily - a news app with 8 categories only loads the visible tab, saving memory and startup time.

**Parallel Information**: Perfect for data that exists simultaneously - not sequential steps. Settings categories, news sections, and chat types are naturally parallel.

**Real-world impact**: Google Play redesigned from drawer navigation to tabs and saw 20% more category exploration, because features were discoverable instead of hidden.

**User Expectation**: After 15 years of mobile apps, users instinctively swipe between tabs. Fighting this pattern frustrates users and increases bounce rates by 40%.
