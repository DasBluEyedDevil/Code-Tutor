You have learned comprehensive API contract testing strategies for Dart backends:

**What is Contract Testing:**
- Agreements between API providers and consumers
- Prevents integration failures before production
- Enables independent team development

**Serverpod's Type-Safe Advantage:**
- Generated code ensures compile-time contract safety
- Single source of truth for models

**OpenAPI for REST APIs:**
- Industry-standard specification format
- Enables code generation and validation

**Version Compatibility:**
- Test client/server version matrices
- Document compatibility requirements

**Breaking Change Detection:**
- Automate schema comparison
- Catch issues in CI, not production

With these skills, you can ensure your frontend and backend stay synchronized as your application evolves.
