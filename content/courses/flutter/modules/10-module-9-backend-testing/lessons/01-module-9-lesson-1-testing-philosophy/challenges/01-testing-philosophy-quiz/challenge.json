  "description": "Test your understanding of testing concepts and the test pyramid.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "text": "According to the test pyramid, which type of test should you have the MOST of?",
      "options": [
        "End-to-end tests",
        "Integration tests",
        "Unit tests",
        "Manual tests"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Unit tests form the base of the pyramid. They are fast, cheap to write, and catch bugs at the source. You should have many more unit tests than integration or E2E tests."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "text": "In TDD, what should you do FIRST?",
      "options": [
        "Write the implementation code",
        "Write a failing test",
        "Refactor existing code",
        "Set up the database"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "TDD follows Red-Green-Refactor. The first step (Red) is to write a test that fails because the feature does not exist yet. Only then do you write the implementation."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "text": "Which code should be your HIGHEST priority to test?",
      "options": [
        "Simple getters and setters",
        "Generated code from build_runner",
        "Business logic and security-sensitive code",
        "Configuration files"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Business logic (calculations, validation) and security code (authentication, authorization) are critical and should always have thorough test coverage."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "text": "What is a common mistake when writing tests?",
      "options": [
        "Testing observable behavior",
        "Testing edge cases",
        "Testing private implementation details",
        "Using descriptive test names"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Testing private implementation details makes tests brittle. When you refactor internals, tests break even though the external behavior is unchanged. Focus on testing observable behavior instead."
