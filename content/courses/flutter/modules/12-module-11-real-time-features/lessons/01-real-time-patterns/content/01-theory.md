Real-time communication enables instant data updates between clients and servers without requiring users to refresh or poll manually. In modern applications, users expect immediate feedback - whether it's a chat message appearing instantly, a notification badge updating, or a live dashboard reflecting current data.

**What is Real-Time?**

Real-time means data is delivered to users as soon as it's available, with minimal latency (typically under 100ms for most use cases). This creates responsive, engaging user experiences.

**Common Real-Time Use Cases:**

- **Chat Applications**: Messages appear instantly for all participants
- **Live Notifications**: Push alerts for new orders, messages, or events
- **Collaborative Editing**: Multiple users editing the same document
- **Live Dashboards**: Stock prices, analytics, or IoT sensor data
- **Presence Indicators**: Showing who's online or typing
- **Gaming**: Multiplayer game state synchronization
- **Live Streaming**: Comments and reactions during broadcasts

**Why Real-Time Matters:**

Traditional request-response patterns require the client to ask for updates. Real-time flips this model - the server pushes updates to clients when data changes. This reduces latency, improves UX, and enables entirely new feature categories.
