Serverpod provides a powerful streaming architecture that enables real-time data flow between your Flutter app and backend. Unlike traditional request-response patterns, streams allow the server to push data to clients as it becomes available, creating truly reactive applications.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Understanding Serverpod's streaming architecture
- Working with StreamingSession for bidirectional communication
- Creating and subscribing to server-side streams
- Managing connection state and reconnection logic
- Proper stream lifecycle management to avoid memory leaks
- Handling errors and implementing recovery patterns

**Why Serverpod Streams?**

Serverpod streams are built on WebSockets but provide a higher-level abstraction that integrates seamlessly with Dart's Stream API. This means you get type-safe, code-generated streaming endpoints that work naturally with Flutter's reactive patterns.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Live chat and messaging
- Real-time notifications
- Live dashboards and monitoring
- Collaborative editing
- Gaming state synchronization
- IoT data streaming
