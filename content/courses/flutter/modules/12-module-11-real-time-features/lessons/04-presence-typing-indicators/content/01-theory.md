Presence and typing indicators transform chat from a static message exchange into a living, breathing conversation. When users see that someone is online or actively typing, they know the other person is engaged and responsive. This lesson teaches you how to implement these real-time presence features using Serverpod streams.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Understanding presence systems and their UX impact
- Tracking user connection state on the server
- Broadcasting presence changes to other users
- Implementing typing indicators with proper debouncing
- Managing state efficiently to avoid update floods
- Building polished UI components for status display

**Why Presence Matters:**

Presence indicators serve multiple UX purposes:
- **Availability**: Users know if someone can respond immediately
- **Engagement**: Typing indicators show active participation
- **Expectations**: Online status sets response time expectations
- **Social proof**: Seeing others online creates community feeling

Without presence, users send messages into a void, unsure if anyone will see them. With presence, conversations feel immediate and connected.
