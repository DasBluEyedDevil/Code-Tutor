title: "What Exactly is a Widget?"

**Conceptual First**: A widget is anything you see on screen:
- Text? That's a widget.
- Button? That's a widget.
- Image? That's a widget.
- The layout that arranges them? Also a widget!

**Technical Term**: In Flutter, **everything is a widget**. Widgets are the building blocks of your app's user interface.
