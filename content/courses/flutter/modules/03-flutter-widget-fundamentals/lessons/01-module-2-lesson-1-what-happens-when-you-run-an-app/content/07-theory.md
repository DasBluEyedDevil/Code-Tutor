You've now seen your first **widgets**!

**Conceptual First**: Think of widgets as LEGO pieces. Each piece is a building block:
- A `Text` widget is like a LEGO piece with letters on it
- A `Center` widget is like a LEGO baseplate that centers other pieces
- A `MaterialApp` widget is like the LEGO box that holds everything together

You snap these pieces together to build your app!

**Now the Technical Term**: Widgets are the building blocks of Flutter apps. Everything you see on the screen is a widget - text, buttons, images, layouts, everything.
