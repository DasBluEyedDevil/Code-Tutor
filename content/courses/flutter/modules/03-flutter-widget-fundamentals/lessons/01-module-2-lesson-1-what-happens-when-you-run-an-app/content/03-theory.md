Think of `main()` like the "Start" button on a video game.

When you press "Run" in VS Code:
1. Flutter looks for the `main()` function
2. Executes whatever code is inside it
3. Your app comes to life!

**Every Dart and Flutter program must have a `main()` function.** Without it, the program doesn't know where to begin.
