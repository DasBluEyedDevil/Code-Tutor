**Q: Why do we need both `MaterialApp` and `Center`?**
A: `MaterialApp` sets up the app foundation. `Center` positions the content. They serve different purposes!

**Q: What if I forget the `import` statement?**
A: You'll get errors like "Undefined name 'MaterialApp'". The import brings in the tools you need.

**Q: Can I have multiple `main()` functions?**
A: No! Each program has exactly one `main()` function as the entry point.

**Q: Why all the commas?**
A: Commas separate properties and parameters. It's how Dart knows where one thing ends and another begins.
