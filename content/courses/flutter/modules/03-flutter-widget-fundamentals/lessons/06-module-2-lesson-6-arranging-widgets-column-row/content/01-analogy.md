You know how to create individual widgets (Text, Image, Container). But real apps have MANY widgets on screen:
- A profile screen: photo + name + bio + buttons
- A login screen: logo + text fields + button
- A feed: many posts stacked vertically

**How do we arrange multiple widgets?** Enter `Column` and `Row`!
