You've seen the `Text` widget briefly. Now let's master it! Text is the most common widget you'll use - every app shows text somewhere.

Think of the Text widget like a word processor:
- You can change the **font size**
- You can change the **color**
- You can make it **bold** or *italic*
- You can **align** it

All of this is possible with Flutter's Text widget!
