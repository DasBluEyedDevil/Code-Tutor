### Step 1: Create an assets folder


### Step 2: Add images

Put your image files (like `logo.png`) in `assets/images/`

### Step 3: Register in pubspec.yaml

Edit `pubspec.yaml`:


**Important**: Indentation matters in YAML!

### Step 4: Use in code




```dart
Image.asset('assets/images/logo.png')
```
