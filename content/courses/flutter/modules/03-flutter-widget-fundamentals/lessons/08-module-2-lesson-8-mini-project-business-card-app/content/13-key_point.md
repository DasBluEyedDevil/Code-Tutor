- Combine Column, Row, Container, Text, Image, and Icon widgets to build real UI layouts from simple building blocks
- Extract repeated UI patterns into custom widgets (e.g., `ContactInfo`) to keep your build methods short and readable
- Use `CircleAvatar` for profile pictures -- it handles circular clipping and fallback initials automatically
- Apply consistent spacing with `SizedBox` between widgets rather than adding padding to every individual widget
- Test your layout on different screen sizes early to catch overflow issues before they reach users
