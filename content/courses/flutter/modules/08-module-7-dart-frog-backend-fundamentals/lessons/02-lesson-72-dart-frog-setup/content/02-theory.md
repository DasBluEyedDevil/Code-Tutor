With the CLI installed, creating a new Dart Frog project is one command:

```bash
dart_frog create my_api
```

**What Happens**:
1. Dart Frog creates a new directory called `my_api`
2. Sets up the project structure
3. Installs dependencies automatically

**Navigate into Your Project**:

```bash
cd my_api
```

**Your First Project is Ready!**

Let's explore what was created.
