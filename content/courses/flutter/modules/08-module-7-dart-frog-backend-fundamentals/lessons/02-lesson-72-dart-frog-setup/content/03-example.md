Open your new `my_api` folder in VS Code. Here's what you'll see:



```text
my_api/
|-- routes/
|   |-- index.dart          # Your first endpoint: GET /
|
|-- main.dart                # Entry point (rarely modified)
|-- pubspec.yaml             # Dependencies (like Flutter's pubspec)
|
|-- test/                    # Tests go here
|   |-- routes/
|       |-- index_test.dart  # Test for the index route
|
|-- .dart_frog/              # Generated files (don't edit)
|-- analysis_options.yaml    # Linter settings
```
