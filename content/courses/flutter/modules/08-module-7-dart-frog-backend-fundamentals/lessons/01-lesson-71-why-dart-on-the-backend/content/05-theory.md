In this module, you will build a complete REST API with Dart Frog. Here's the roadmap:

**Lesson 7.1 (This Lesson)**: Why Dart on the Backend?
- Understand the full-stack Dart advantage
- Compare Shelf, Dart Frog, and Serverpod
- See shared code in action

**Lesson 7.2**: Dart Frog Setup
- Install Dart Frog CLI
- Create your first project
- Understand file-based routing
- Run the dev server with hot reload

**Upcoming Lessons**:
- Creating Routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Path Parameters and Query Strings
- Request Bodies and JSON Handling
- Middleware (logging, authentication)
- Error Handling
- Connecting to a Database
- Testing Your API

**By the End of Module 7**:
You'll have a working REST API that could serve a real Flutter application. You'll understand how backend code works, how to structure it, and how to test it.

Let's get building!
