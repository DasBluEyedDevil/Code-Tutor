  "description": "Create a workflow that builds Android APK and deploys to Play Store internal track.",
  "instructions": "Complete the deployment workflow that:\n\n1. Triggers when a version tag (v*) is pushed\n2. Decodes the keystore from a base64 secret\n3. Builds a signed release APK using environment variables for signing\n4. Uploads the APK as an artifact with 14-day retention\n5. Deploys to Google Play Store internal track using the upload action",

  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "hints": [
    "Use 'v*' pattern to match tags like v1.0.0, v2.1.3, etc.",
    "The keystore secret should be named KEYSTORE_BASE64 for clarity",
    "Add --release flag to build a release APK",
    "The internal track is used for internal testing before wider release"
