  "title": "Production Dockerfile Optimization",
  "description": "Create an optimized multi-stage Dockerfile for a Dart backend with security best practices.",
  "instructions": "Complete the production Dockerfile for a Serverpod backend. Your Dockerfile should:\n\n1. Use multi-stage builds to minimize final image size\n2. Create a non-root user called 'appuser' for security\n3. Include a HEALTHCHECK instruction\n4. Copy only the compiled server binary and necessary config files\n5. Set appropriate environment variables for production",
  "language": "dockerfile",
  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "hints": [
    "Alpine needs libc6-compat for Dart compiled binaries to run",
    "Include ca-certificates for HTTPS connections and wget for health checks",
    "The config directory contains production.yaml and other essential configuration",
    "Use wget in HEALTHCHECK since curl isn't included in Alpine by default"
