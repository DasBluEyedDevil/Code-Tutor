  "description": "Choose the appropriate release track for different testing scenarios.",
  "instructions": "Your Flutter app is ready for broader testing. You want external beta testers (about 500 people) to test the app, but you don't want it to appear in Play Store search results yet. Which release track should you use?",

      "text": "Production track with 1% staged rollout"
    }
  ],
  "correctAnswer": "b",
  "explanation": "The closed testing track is ideal for this scenario. It allows you to invite up to 10,000 testers via email lists or Google Groups, requires testers to opt-in (keeping it private), and doesn't appear in Play Store search results. Internal testing is limited to 100 testers which is too few. Open testing would make the app discoverable in the Play Store. Production track is for full release, not testing.",
