**Creating Effective Screenshots:**

1. **Tell a Story:**
   - First screenshot should show core functionality
   - Sequence screenshots to show user journey
   - End with social proof or unique differentiator

2. **Add Context:**
   - Include captions explaining benefits (not just features)
   - Use device frames for professional look
   - Keep text readable on small screens (large fonts)

3. **Localize:**
   - Create screenshots for each supported language
   - Show localized UI, not just translated captions
   - Different markets may respond to different features

4. **A/B Test:**
   - Google Play allows store listing experiments
   - Test different screenshots, descriptions, icons
   - Use data to optimize conversion rates

**Common Screenshot Mistakes:**

- Too much text (users don't read on store pages)
- Showing login/signup screens first
- Low contrast text on image backgrounds
- Screenshots that look like every other app in the category
- Not showing what makes your app unique
