**Creating a Compelling Store Listing**

Your store listing is your app's first impression. It determines whether users install your app or scroll past.

**App Name and Branding:**

- **App name:** Up to 30 characters
- Must be unique and not impersonate other apps
- Cannot contain performance claims without verification (e.g., "#1 Photo App")
- Avoid keyword stuffing ("Photo Editor Free Camera Filter Effects Collage")

**Short Description:**

- Maximum 80 characters
- Appears in search results and at top of store listing
- Focus on primary value proposition
- Example: "Edit photos with AI-powered filters and one-tap enhancements"

**Full Description:**

- Maximum 4,000 characters
- Use the first 1-2 sentences to hook users (visible without expanding)
- Include key features with bullet points or line breaks
- Mention what makes your app unique
- Include relevant keywords naturally (not stuffed)
- Can use basic formatting: line breaks work, but no HTML/markdown

**Description Best Practices:**

1. Lead with benefits, not features
2. Use "you" language to speak directly to users
3. Include social proof if available (awards, press mentions, user count)
4. End with a call to action
5. Keep paragraphs short for mobile reading
