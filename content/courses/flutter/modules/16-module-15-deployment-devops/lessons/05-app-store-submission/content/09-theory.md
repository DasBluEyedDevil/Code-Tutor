**When Your App is Rejected**

Rejections happen. Here's how to handle them professionally:

**Step 1: Read the Resolution Center**

In App Store Connect:
1. Go to your app
2. Check the Resolution Center
3. Read the specific rejection reason
4. Note which guideline was cited

**Step 2: Understand the Issue**

- Is it a legitimate policy violation?
- Is it a misunderstanding about functionality?
- Did the reviewer miss something?
- Is additional explanation needed?

**Step 3: Choose Your Response**

**Option A - Fix and Resubmit:**
- Make required changes
- Upload new build
- Explain fixes in review notes
- Submit for review again

**Option B - Reply in Resolution Center:**
- Provide clarification
- Explain why app complies
- Offer demo video or additional notes
- Request re-review

**Option C - Appeal the Decision:**
- Use App Review Board appeal
- Explain why you believe decision is incorrect
- Cite relevant guidelines
- Be professional and factual

**Appeal Best Practices:**

- Stay calm and professional
- Provide specific evidence
- Reference exact guideline sections
- Don't resubmit the same rejected build
- Appeals take 2-5 business days

**Expedited Review:**

For critical bug fixes or time-sensitive updates:
1. Submit normally
2. Request expedited review via link in App Store Connect
3. Explain urgency (not guaranteed)
