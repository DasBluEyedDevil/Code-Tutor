**Apple's Device Limits:**

- 100 iPhones per year
- 100 iPads per year
- 100 Apple Watches per year
- 100 Apple TVs per year
- 100 Macs per year

**Important Notes:**

1. Devices count against your limit for the entire membership year
2. Removing a device does NOT free up a slot until next year
3. Device list resets when you renew your membership
4. For larger beta testing, use TestFlight (10,000 external testers)

**Managing Devices:**
- Add devices in Apple Developer Portal -> Devices
- Or let Xcode register devices automatically when you first run on them
- Use descriptive names for easy identification
