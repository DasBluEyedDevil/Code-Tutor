Think of Serverpod model definitions like an architectural blueprint for a building.

**Without a Blueprint (Traditional Approach)**:
- The foundation team builds based on verbal instructions
- The framing team interprets things differently
- The electrician makes assumptions about wall locations
- Everyone works from different understandings
- The building has misaligned walls and broken connections

**With a Blueprint (Serverpod Approach)**:
- ONE master document defines everything
- Foundation team reads the blueprint
- Framing team reads the SAME blueprint
- Electrician reads the SAME blueprint
- Everyone builds from a single source of truth
- The building comes together perfectly

**In Serverpod:**
- Your YAML model definition is the blueprint
- The server code reads from this blueprint
- The client code reads from the SAME blueprint
- The protocol (API contract) reads from the SAME blueprint
- Everything stays perfectly aligned

One definition. Perfect synchronization. No drift.
