### Frontend (Your Flutter App) = The Dining Room
This is what customers see and interact with:
- 🪑 Tables and chairs (UI widgets)
- 📋 Menu (app screens)
- 🍽️ Plates and silverware (controls like buttons)

**What it CANNOT do**:
- ❌ Store food ingredients
- ❌ Cook the meals
- ❌ Manage inventory

### Backend (Cloud Server) = The Kitchen
This is the behind-the-scenes operation:
- 🍳 Cooks prepare the food (process data)
- 📦 Storage for ingredients (database)
- 👨‍🍳 Multiple chefs coordinate (handles many users at once)
- 📝 Recipe book (business logic)

**Your Flutter app (dining room) talks to the backend (kitchen) through the waiter (API).**
