**Every app needs to store data.**

- **Instagram**: Stores billions of posts, comments, likes
- **Twitter**: Real-time tweets synced across devices
- **Spotify**: Playlists, listening history, preferences
- **Without a database**, your app loses all data when closed
- **99% of apps** use a database to persist user data

Cloud Firestore is Google's modern database that automatically syncs data across all devices in real-time.
