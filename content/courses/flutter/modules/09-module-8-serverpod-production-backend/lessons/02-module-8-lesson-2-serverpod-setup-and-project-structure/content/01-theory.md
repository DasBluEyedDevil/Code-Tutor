In this lesson, you will set up a complete Serverpod development environment. By the end, you will have:

- Serverpod CLI installed and working
- A new Serverpod project with three connected packages
- Docker running PostgreSQL and Redis
- VS Code configured for Serverpod development
- Your first API endpoint running with hot reload

This is the foundation for everything else in this module. Take your time and verify each step works before moving on.
