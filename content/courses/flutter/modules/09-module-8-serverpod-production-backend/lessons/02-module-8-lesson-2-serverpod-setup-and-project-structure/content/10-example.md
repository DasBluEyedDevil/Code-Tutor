With Docker running, you can now start the Serverpod development server:



```bash
# From my_app_server directory

# Start the server in development mode
dart run bin/main.dart

# You should see output like:
# Starting Serverpod.
# Server default port: 8080
# Server insights port: 8081
# Server id: 0
# Serverpod is running.

# Your API is now available at:
# http://localhost:8080/

# The insights dashboard is at:
# http://localhost:8081/

# To stop the server, press Ctrl+C
```
