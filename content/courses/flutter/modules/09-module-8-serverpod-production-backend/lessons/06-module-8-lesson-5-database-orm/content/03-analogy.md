Imagine you are a business owner who needs to communicate with suppliers in different countries. You speak English, but your suppliers speak Spanish, German, and Japanese.

**Without a Translator (No ORM):**
- You must learn each language yourself
- Easy to make grammar mistakes
- You might accidentally insult someone with wrong phrasing
- Every new supplier country means learning another language

**With a Professional Translator (ORM):**
- You speak your native language (Dart)
- The translator converts to the target language (SQL)
- The translator knows grammar and idioms perfectly
- Adding new suppliers is seamless

The ORM is your translator between Dart (your language) and PostgreSQL (the database's language). You describe what you want in Dart objects and method calls, and the ORM generates the correct SQL queries.
