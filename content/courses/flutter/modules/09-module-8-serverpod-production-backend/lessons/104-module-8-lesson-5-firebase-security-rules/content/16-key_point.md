✅ Security rules are your firewall between users and data
✅ Always enforce security on the server (never trust client code)
✅ Start with deny-all, gradually allow specific operations
✅ Validate all data (types, sizes, required fields)
✅ Test rules thoroughly before production
✅ Users should only access their own data (userId matching)
✅ File uploads need size and type validation
✅ Monitor rule violations to detect attacks and bugs

**Your app is now production-ready and secure!** 🔐
