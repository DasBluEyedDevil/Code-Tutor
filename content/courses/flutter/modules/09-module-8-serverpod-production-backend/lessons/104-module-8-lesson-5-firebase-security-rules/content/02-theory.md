**Security rules are the MOST IMPORTANT part of Firebase.**

- **Without security rules**, anyone can read/write your entire database
- **Data breaches** happen when developers forget to set rules
- **Firebase projects get hacked** every day due to weak security
- **Security rules** are your firewall between users and data
- **Production apps** MUST have proper security rules

**Real example**: In 2020, millions of Firebase databases were exposed online because developers used test mode rules in production.
