### Without Authentication
Imagine a hotel where anyone can:
- 🚪 Enter any room
- 📝 Access anyone's information
- 💳 See anyone's billing
- 🔑 No keys needed

**This would be chaos!**

### With Authentication
Proper hotel check-in:
1. **Register** (first visit): Show ID, get a room key
2. **Login** (returning guest): Show ID, get your key
3. **Your Room Only**: Your key only opens YOUR room
4. **Session**: Key works for duration of your stay
5. **Logout** (checkout): Return key, can't access room anymore

**Firebase Authentication is your app's hotel check-in system.**
