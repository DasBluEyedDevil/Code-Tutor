### Answer 1: B
**Correct**: To ensure users own the email and can recover their account

Email verification confirms the user has access to the email address they provided. This prevents fake accounts, enables password recovery, and ensures you can communicate with users.

### Answer 2: B
**Correct**: It returns a Stream that emits whenever the user signs in or out

`authStateChanges()` returns a Stream<User?> that automatically updates when authentication state changes. Use it with StreamBuilder to automatically show login/home screens based on auth status.

### Answer 3: B
**Correct**: It increases signup rates (50%+) and provides better UX

Social login reduces friction (no password to remember), increases trust (familiar Google logo), and significantly improves conversion rates. Users are 50% more likely to complete signup with social login.
