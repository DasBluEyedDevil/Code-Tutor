### Before Cloud Storage = Physical Photo Album
- 📸 Take photo → develop film → store in album
- 📦 Album stored in your house only
- ❌ Lose the album, lose all photos
- ❌ Can't share with friends easily
- ❌ Limited by physical space

### With Cloud Storage = Online Photo Service (Google Photos)
- 📸 Take photo → automatically uploads to cloud
- ☁️ Stored on servers worldwide (safe and redundant)
- ✅ Access from any device
- ✅ Share with anyone via link
- ✅ Unlimited storage (in cloud)
- 🔐 Protected by authentication

**Firebase Storage is your app's photo lab in the cloud!**
