### Notifications ✅ DO:
1. **Request permission at the right time** (after user sees value)
2. **Personalize notifications** (use user's name, relevant content)
3. **Don't spam** (max 2-3 per day)
4. **Provide value** (useful info, not just "Open the app!")
5. **Allow unsubscribe** (topic-based subscriptions)
6. **Test on real devices** (not just emulator)
7. **Handle tap actions** (navigate to relevant screen)

### Notifications ❌ DON'T:
1. **Don't request permission immediately** on app launch
2. **Don't send at bad times** (2am notifications = angry users)
3. **Don't send generic messages** ("Check out our app!")
4. **Don't ignore user preferences** (respect opt-outs)
5. **Don't forget to test** on iOS and Android

### Analytics ✅ DO:
1. **Track key user actions** (signup, purchase, share)
2. **Set user properties** (subscription type, preferences)
3. **Create conversion funnels** (how many complete signup?)
4. **Review weekly** (make data-driven decisions)
5. **Respect privacy** (don't track sensitive data)

### Analytics ❌ DON'T:
1. **Don't track PII** (passwords, credit cards, SSN)
2. **Don't track everything** (focus on meaningful events)
3. **Don't ignore the data** (collect but never analyze = waste)
4. **Don't violate privacy laws** (GDPR, CCPA compliance)
