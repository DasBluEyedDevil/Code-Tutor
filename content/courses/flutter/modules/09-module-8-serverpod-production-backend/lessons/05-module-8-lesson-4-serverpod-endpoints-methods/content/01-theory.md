In this lesson, you will master Serverpod's endpoint system - the way your Flutter app communicates with your Dart server. By the end, you will be able to create API endpoints, handle authentication, work with databases, and call your server methods from Flutter.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Create endpoint classes that extend the Endpoint base class
- Understand the Session parameter and its capabilities
- Define methods with proper return types and automatic serialization
- Call endpoints from your Flutter client with full type safety
- Handle errors gracefully in endpoints
- Organize endpoints following best practices
