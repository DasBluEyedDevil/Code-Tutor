---

**Local Server Storage is like a Personal Safe at Home:**
- You buy the safe (pay for disk space)
- Limited size - when full, buy another
- If your house floods, the safe is damaged
- You are responsible for security
- Only you can access it
- Moving requires carrying the heavy safe

**Cloud Storage is like a Bank Vault:**
- The bank maintains the vault (managed service)
- Virtually unlimited space - pay for what you use
- Multiple locations - if one branch floods, others are fine
- Professional security team
- Controlled access with permissions
- Access from any branch (global CDN)

**Why Apps Use Cloud Storage:**

Imagine you run an app with 1 million users, each with a profile picture:
- Average image size: 500 KB
- Total storage: 500 GB
- If stored on server: Need expensive high-capacity server
- With cloud storage: Costs about $12/month for storage
- Plus: Automatic backup, global access, no maintenance

Cloud storage is not just convenient - it is the only practical solution for production applications at scale.
