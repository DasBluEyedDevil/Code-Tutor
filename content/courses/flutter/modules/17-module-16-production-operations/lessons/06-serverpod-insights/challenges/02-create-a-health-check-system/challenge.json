  "description": "Build a comprehensive health check system that monitors database, cache, and external services.",
  "instructions": "Create a HealthChecker class that:\n\n1. Defines a HealthCheck result class with name, status, latency, and error\n2. Implements checkDatabase() that tests database connectivity\n3. Implements checkCache() that tests Redis/cache connectivity\n4. Implements checkAll() that runs all checks and returns aggregate status\n5. Calculates overall system health based on individual check results\n6. Handles timeouts gracefully (max 5 seconds per check)",
