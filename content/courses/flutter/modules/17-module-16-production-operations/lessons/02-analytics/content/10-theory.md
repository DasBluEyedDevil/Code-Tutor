**The AARRR Framework (Pirate Metrics)**

A proven framework for what to measure in your app:

| Stage | Question | Example Events |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Acquisition** | How do users find us? | app_open, referral_source |
| **Activation** | Do they have a good first experience? | complete_onboarding, first_action |
| **Retention** | Do they come back? | session_start, feature_usage |
| **Revenue** | Do they pay? | purchase, subscription_start |
| **Referral** | Do they tell others? | share_content, invite_friend |

**Key Metrics by App Type**

*E-commerce:*
- Product views
- Add to cart rate
- Cart abandonment
- Purchase conversion
- Average order value

*Content/Media:*
- Article/video views
- Time spent
- Scroll depth
- Share rate
- Return visits

*Productivity:*
- Feature adoption
- Task completion
- Session frequency
- Time to value
- Power user percentage

*Social:*
- Posts created
- Engagement (likes, comments)
- Connections made
- Daily active users
- Time in app

**From Data to Decisions**

Analytics is only valuable if it leads to action:

1. **Identify the question** - What decision are you trying to make?
2. **Choose the metric** - What data would answer that question?
3. **Set up tracking** - Implement the necessary events
4. **Analyze results** - Look for patterns and insights
5. **Take action** - Make changes based on data
6. **Measure impact** - Did your change help?

**Common Mistakes**

- Tracking everything (analysis paralysis)
- Vanity metrics (downloads instead of active users)
- Not defining success criteria upfront
- Ignoring qualitative feedback
- Acting on small sample sizes
