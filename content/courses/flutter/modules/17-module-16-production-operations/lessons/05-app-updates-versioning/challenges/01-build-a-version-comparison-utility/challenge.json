  "description": "Create a robust version comparison utility that handles semantic versioning including pre-release versions.",
  "instructions": "Create a Version class that:\n\n1. Parses version strings like '2.4.1', '2.4.1-beta.1', '2.4.1+45'\n2. Has properties for major, minor, patch, preRelease, and buildNumber\n3. Implements comparison operators (==, <, >, <=, >=)\n4. Handles edge cases (missing components default to 0, pre-release < release)\n5. Has a static compareTo method that returns -1, 0, or 1\n6. Has isNewerThan(other) and isOlderThan(other) convenience methods",
