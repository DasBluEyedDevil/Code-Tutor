You can build beautiful layouts, but they don't DO anything yet! In the next module, you'll learn:
- **Buttons & Gestures**: Handling taps and swipes
- **StatefulWidgets**: Making your UI change when data changes
- **TextFields**: Getting text input from users
- **Forms**: Validating and submitting user data

Get ready to make your apps come alive! 🚀
