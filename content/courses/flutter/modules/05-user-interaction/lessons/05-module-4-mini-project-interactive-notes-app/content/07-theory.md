**Module 5: Professional Architecture!**

Your notes app works great, but all the logic is stuffed inside the UI files. This becomes messy as apps grow.

In the next module, we'll learn:
- **Riverpod**: The modern way to manage state.
- **MVVM**: How to separate your UI from your business logic.
- **Service Layers**: How to organize API calls and data storage.

Get ready to level up from "making apps" to "engineering software"! 🚀
