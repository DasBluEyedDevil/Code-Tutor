title: "The Tab Navigation Pattern"
---


You've seen this everywhere:
- **WhatsApp**: Chats, Status, Calls (3 tabs at top)
- **Google Play**: Apps, Games, Movies (tabs for categories)
- **Settings Apps**: General, Privacy, Security (organize settings)

**Tabs are perfect for:**
- Related content categories
- Parallel information architecture
- Horizontal navigation within a screen

**Think of tabs like folders in a filing cabinet** - same drawer, different sections!
