**URL-based navigation is crucial for:**
- **Web apps**: Users can bookmark and share specific pages
- **Deep linking**: Open your app directly to a product page from a marketing email
- **SEO**: Search engines can index your Flutter web app
- **State management**: The URL becomes your source of truth
- **Testing**: Easy to test specific routes without complex widget trees

**Real-world scenario**: You're building a social media app. A user shares a post link: `myapp://post/abc123`. With GoRouter, this automatically opens your app to that exact post - no complex routing logic needed!
