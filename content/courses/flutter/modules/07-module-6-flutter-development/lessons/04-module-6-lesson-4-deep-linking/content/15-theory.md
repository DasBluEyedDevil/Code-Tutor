**Deep linking is essential for:**

**Marketing**: Share product links via email/SMS that open directly in your app, increasing conversions by 2-3x compared to "open app → search" flows.

**User Experience**: User taps Instagram notification → Opens directly to that specific post, not the home feed. This seamless experience is expected in modern apps.

**Re-engagement**: Send push notification with deep link to abandoned cart → User taps → Opens app directly to checkout, recovering lost sales.

**Sharing**: User shares an interesting article from your news app → Friend taps link → Opens in app with content ready, creating viral growth loops.

**Cross-platform**: Same link works on iOS, Android, and Web, simplifying your marketing efforts.

**Real-world impact**: Airbnb saw 30% increase in bookings after implementing deep linking for shared listings!
