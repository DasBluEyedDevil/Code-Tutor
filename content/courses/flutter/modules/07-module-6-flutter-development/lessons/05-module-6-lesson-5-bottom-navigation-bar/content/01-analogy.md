Most popular apps have the same navigation pattern:
- **Instagram**: Home, Search, Reels, Shop, Profile (5 tabs at bottom)
- **Twitter**: Home, Search, Notifications, Messages (4 tabs at bottom)
- **YouTube**: Home, Shorts, +, Subscriptions, Library (5 tabs at bottom)

**Why bottom navigation?**
- Easy thumb reach on phones 👍
- Always visible (persistent navigation)
- Clear visual feedback (which tab you're on)
- Industry standard pattern

**Flutter makes this easy!**
