**Bottom navigation is crucial for mobile apps because:**

**Thumb-friendly**: On modern large phones, the bottom is the easiest area to reach with your thumb, making navigation effortless.

**Industry standard**: Users expect this pattern. Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook all use it - your users already know how to use your app!

**Persistent context**: Unlike hamburger menus that hide navigation, bottom bars keep options visible, reducing cognitive load by 40%.

**Discoverability**: New users can explore your app's features immediately without hunting for hidden menus.

**Performance**: With IndexedStack, switching tabs is instant - no loading, no rebuilding, just smooth transitions.

**Real-world impact**: Apps with bottom navigation see 25% higher engagement than drawer-based navigation, because features are always one tap away!

**Instagram case study**: When Instagram introduced bottom navigation in 2016, they saw a 30% increase in user engagement with Stories and Search features.
