This project combined EVERYTHING from Module 4:
- ✅ **Interactivity**: Buttons and FABs trigger actions.
- ✅ **Input**: TextFields and Controllers gather user data.
- ✅ **State**: `StatefulWidget` manages our list of notes.
- ✅ **Gestures**: `Dismissible` adds modern touch interactions.
- ✅ **Feedback**: `SnackBar` informs the user of successful actions.

You've built a real, functional application that users can actually use!
