  "description": "Build a connection manager that handles the complete streaming lifecycle.",
  "instructions": "Create a StreamingConnectionManager class that:\n\n1. Opens and maintains a streaming connection\n2. Tracks connection state (disconnected, connecting, connected, reconnecting)\n3. Implements automatic reconnection with exponential backoff\n4. Exposes a stream of connection state changes\n5. Properly disposes all resources\n\nRequirements:\n- Maximum 5 reconnection attempts\n- Backoff delays: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s\n- Expose connectionState as a Stream\n- Include a manual reconnect() method\n- Cancel all timers and subscriptions in dispose()",
