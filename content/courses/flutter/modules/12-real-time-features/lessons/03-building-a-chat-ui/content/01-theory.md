A chat interface is one of the most complex and rewarding UIs to build. It combines real-time data, smooth animations, intelligent scrolling, and thoughtful UX into a cohesive experience. This lesson teaches you how to build a production-quality chat UI that feels as polished as WhatsApp or iMessage.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Structuring chat UI components for maintainability
- Building efficient message lists with reverse scrolling
- Designing message bubbles for sent and received messages
- Creating a feature-rich input field with multi-line support
- Integrating real-time updates from Serverpod streams
- Implementing intelligent scroll behavior

**UX Considerations:**

A great chat UI should:
- Load instantly and scroll smoothly
- Clearly distinguish between sent and received messages
- Show message status (sending, sent, delivered, read)
- Auto-scroll on new messages when at the bottom
- Provide a scroll-to-bottom button when viewing history
- Handle keyboard appearance gracefully
- Support accessibility features
