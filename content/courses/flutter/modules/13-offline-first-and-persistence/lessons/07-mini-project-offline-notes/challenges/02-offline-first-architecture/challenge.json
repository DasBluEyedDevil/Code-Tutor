    {
      "question": "What should happen when a user creates a note while offline?",
      "options": [
        "Show an error and prevent creation",
        "Save locally and queue for sync when online",
        "Wait until online to save",
        "Save to a temporary cache only"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In offline-first architecture, the note should be saved to the local database immediately and a sync operation queued. When connectivity is restored, the sync queue processes and pushes changes to the server."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do we use UUIDs instead of auto-increment IDs in offline-first apps?",
      "options": [
        "UUIDs are faster to generate",
        "Auto-increment requires server roundtrip to get the ID",
        "UUIDs are more secure",
        "The database requires UUIDs"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Auto-increment IDs require the server to assign the ID, which is not possible offline. UUIDs can be generated client-side without any server communication, making them ideal for offline-first apps."
