  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "In a local-first architecture, when should you write to the local database?",
      "options": [
        "After the server confirms the write",
        "Immediately when the user takes action",
        "Only when online",
        "After conflict resolution"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In local-first, you write to the local database immediately when the user takes action. This provides instant feedback and works offline. Sync to server happens in the background."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should happen when a sync operation fails due to a network error?",
      "options": [
        "Delete the operation from the queue",
        "Show an error to the user immediately",
        "Keep in queue and retry with exponential backoff",
        "Revert the local change"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Network errors are transient. The operation should stay in the queue and be retried with exponential backoff. The local data remains intact."
