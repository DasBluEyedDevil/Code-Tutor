  "type": "QUIZ",
  "id": "5.3-challenge-1",
  "title": "Project Structure Quiz",
  "description": "Test your understanding of feature-first folder organization.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "text": "Where would you put a reusable 'AppButton' widget that is used across 5 different features?",
      "options": [
        "features/buttons/widgets/app_button.dart",
        "core/widgets/app_button.dart",
        "lib/app_button.dart",
        "features/home/widgets/app_button.dart"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Widgets used by multiple features belong in core/widgets/. This keeps reusable code in one place and prevents features from depending on each other. The core/ folder is for shared code."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "text": "Where would you put the login screen for your authentication feature?",
      "options": [
        "lib/views/login_screen.dart",
        "core/views/login_screen.dart",
        "features/auth/views/login_screen.dart",
        "screens/login_screen.dart"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "In feature-first organization, each feature has its own folder. Login is part of the auth feature, so it goes in features/auth/views/. This keeps all authentication-related code together."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "text": "Your cart feature needs to access the current user's ID. What is the CORRECT way to do this?",
      "options": [
        "Import directly from features/auth/models/user.dart",
        "Copy the user model into features/cart/models/",
        "Use a shared service like services/auth_service.dart",
        "Store user ID in a global variable"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Features should not import from each other directly. Instead, use shared services as intermediaries. This keeps features independent and prevents tight coupling. If auth changes, cart does not break."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "text": "You created a 'ProductRatingStars' widget used ONLY in the product detail screen. Where should it go?",
      "options": [
        "core/widgets/product_rating_stars.dart",
        "features/products/widgets/product_rating_stars.dart",
        "lib/widgets/product_rating_stars.dart",
        "features/common/widgets/product_rating_stars.dart"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "If a widget is only used within one feature, it stays in that feature's widgets/ folder. Only put things in core/ if they are used by 2+ features. This prevents core/ from becoming a dumping ground."
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "text": "What is the MAIN advantage of feature-first folder organization?",
      "options": [
        "Smaller file sizes",
        "Faster app compilation",
        "Related code is grouped together, making features easy to find and modify",
        "Required by Flutter framework"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Feature-first organization groups all code for a feature (models, views, viewmodels, widgets) in one folder. This makes it easy to find everything related to a feature, work on it without jumping between folders, and even delete an entire feature by removing one folder."
