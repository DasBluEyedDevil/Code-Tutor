Architecture is not just about writing clean code. It directly impacts your career as a Flutter developer:

### 1. Professional Teams EXPECT Architecture
Every serious company uses architecture patterns. If you join a team and start writing everything in one widget, you will get feedback in your first code review. Companies use architecture because it lets teams of 5, 50, or 500 developers work on the same codebase without stepping on each other.

### 2. Interview Questions Test This
Senior Flutter roles always ask architecture questions:
- How do you separate business logic from UI?
- How do you structure a large Flutter app?
- How do you make your code testable?
- What patterns do you use for state management?

If you cannot answer these questions confidently, you will not pass technical interviews for mid-level and senior positions.

### 3. Architecture Makes YOU Faster
This might seem counterintuitive. Writing more files seems slower, right? Wrong!

With architecture:
- Finding bugs takes minutes, not hours (you know exactly where to look)
- Adding features is predictable (follow the pattern)
- Refactoring is safe (tests catch issues)
- You can work on the UI while the API changes

The time you invest in architecture pays back 10x as your app grows.
