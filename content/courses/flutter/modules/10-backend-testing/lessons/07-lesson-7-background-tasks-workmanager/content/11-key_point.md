You've mastered background tasks in Flutter! Here's what we covered:

- **Workmanager Setup**: Initialize and configure for Android/iOS
- **One-Time Tasks**: Run background work once
- **Periodic Tasks**: Schedule recurring work with constraints
- **Task Management**: Register, cancel, and handle tasks
- **Best Practices**: Battery efficiency and platform limitations
- **Complete App**: Photo backup with auto-sync

With background tasks, your apps can sync data, perform maintenance, and stay up-to-date even when closed!
