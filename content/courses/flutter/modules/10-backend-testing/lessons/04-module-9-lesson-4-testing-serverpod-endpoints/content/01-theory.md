In this lesson, you will master testing Serverpod endpoints. Serverpod provides powerful testing utilities that make it straightforward to verify your endpoints work correctly with real database interactions and authentication.

Topics covered:
- Serverpod test utilities and TestSession
- Mocking sessions and dependencies
- Testing with a test database (integration tests)
- Testing authenticated endpoints
- Testing streaming endpoints
- Database cleanup between tests

By the end, you will be able to write comprehensive tests that ensure your Serverpod backend is reliable and production-ready.
