For REST APIs (including those built with Dart Frog), **OpenAPI** (formerly Swagger) is the industry standard for defining API contracts.

**What is OpenAPI?**

OpenAPI is a specification format for describing REST APIs. It defines:

- **Endpoints**: Available routes and HTTP methods
- **Request Bodies**: Expected input shapes
- **Response Schemas**: Output data structures
- **Data Types**: Field types, required/optional, constraints
- **Authentication**: Security requirements

**Benefits of OpenAPI:**

1. **Code Generation**: Generate client SDKs and server stubs
2. **Interactive Documentation**: Swagger UI for API exploration
3. **Validation**: Automatic request/response validation
4. **Tooling Ecosystem**: Wide support across languages and frameworks
