    {
      "id": "q1",
      "text": "What is the primary purpose of contract testing?",
      "options": [
        "To test individual functions in isolation",
        "To verify API shape and types match expectations between systems",
        "To test complete user workflows end-to-end",
        "To measure code coverage percentage"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Contract testing specifically verifies that the interface (contract) between systems matches expectations."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "text": "Which is an example of a BREAKING change in an API?",
      "options": [
        "Adding a new optional field to a response",
        "Adding a new endpoint",
        "Removing a field from a response",
        "Adding a new optional query parameter"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Removing a field from a response is a breaking change because existing clients that expect that field will fail."

      "text": "What is the main advantage of Serverpod's approach to contracts?",
      "options": [
        "It generates OpenAPI documentation automatically",
        "It uses compile-time code generation for type-safe client/server communication",
        "It runs faster than other frameworks",
        "It requires no testing at all"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Serverpod generates Dart classes for both server and client from a single model definition, catching type mismatches at compile time."

      "id": "q4",
      "text": "In consumer-driven contract testing, who defines the contract?",
      "options": [
        "The backend team exclusively",
        "The DevOps team",
        "The consumer (frontend) specifies what it needs",
        "The contracts are auto-generated from code"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "In consumer-driven contracts, the consumer (frontend) defines what it needs from the API. The provider (backend) then verifies it can satisfy all consumer contracts."
