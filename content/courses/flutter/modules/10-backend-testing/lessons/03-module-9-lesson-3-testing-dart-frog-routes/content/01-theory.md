In this lesson, you will master testing Dart Frog backend routes. Testing your API endpoints ensures your backend behaves correctly, handles edge cases gracefully, and remains reliable as your codebase grows.

Topics covered:
- Testing request and response handlers
- Mocking RequestContext for isolated tests
- Testing middleware chains
- Testing route parameters (path and query)
- Testing JSON body parsing and validation
- Integration test patterns for Dart Frog

By the end, you will be able to write comprehensive tests that give you confidence in your Dart Frog API.
