You now have the skills to comprehensively test Dart Frog routes:

- **Unit Testing Handlers**: Mock RequestContext and verify responses
- **Middleware Testing**: Test the middleware chain in isolation
- **Route Parameters**: Mock path and query parameters
- **Body Parsing**: Test JSON validation and error handling
- **Integration Tests**: Verify the full request/response cycle

Good tests give you confidence to refactor, add features, and deploy without fear. Start with unit tests for fast feedback, then add integration tests for end-to-end confidence.
