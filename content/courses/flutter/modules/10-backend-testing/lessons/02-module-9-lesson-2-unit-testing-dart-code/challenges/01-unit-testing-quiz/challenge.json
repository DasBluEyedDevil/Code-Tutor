  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "text": "Which matcher would you use to check if a list contains exactly 5 elements?",
      "options": [
        "contains(5)",
        "equals(5)",
        "hasLength(5)",
        "isLength(5)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "hasLength(5) checks if a collection has exactly 5 elements. contains(5) checks if the number 5 is in the list, which is different."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "text": "When using Mocktail, what method do you use to define what a mock should return?",
      "options": [
        "expect()",
        "when()",
        "verify()",
        "mock()"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "when() is used to stub mock behavior. For example: when(() => mock.method()).thenReturn(value). verify() is used after the test to check if methods were called."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "text": "What happens if you forget to use 'await' in an async test?",
      "options": [
        "The test will fail immediately",
        "The test may pass before the async operation completes",
        "Dart will automatically add await",
        "The test runner will show a warning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Without await, the test function returns immediately while the async operation runs in the background. The test may incorrectly pass because assertions run before the operation completes."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "text": "Which function runs before EACH test in a group?",
      "options": [
        "setUpAll()",
        "setUp()",
        "beforeEach()",
        "init()"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "setUp() runs before each individual test. setUpAll() runs once before all tests in the file or group. beforeEach() is not a Dart test function."
