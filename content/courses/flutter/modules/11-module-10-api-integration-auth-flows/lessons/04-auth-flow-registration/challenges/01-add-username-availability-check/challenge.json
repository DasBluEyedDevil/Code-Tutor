  "description": "Extend the registration form to check if a username is available in real-time as the user types, debouncing requests to avoid overwhelming the server.",
  "instructions": "Add a username field to the registration form that:\n\n1. Shows a loading indicator while checking availability\n2. Debounces API calls (wait 500ms after user stops typing)\n3. Shows a green checkmark when username is available\n4. Shows a red X with error message when username is taken\n5. Validates that username is 3-20 characters, alphanumeric with underscores only\n\nCreate the following:\n- A debouncer utility class\n- Username validation logic\n- API call to check availability\n- UI feedback for each state (loading, available, taken, invalid)",
