  "instructions": "Add a 'Remember Me' feature to the login screen that:\n\n1. Shows a checkbox on the login form\n2. When checked, persists the session token securely\n3. When unchecked, clears tokens on app close\n4. Auto-fills the email field if remembered\n5. Respects user's choice on subsequent logins\n\nThe implementation should:\n- Store the preference in secure storage\n- Optionally remember the email for convenience\n- Clear session appropriately based on the setting\n- Work with both email/password and OAuth login",
