In this lesson, you learned:

✅ **CI/CD automates** testing, building, and deployment workflows
✅ **GitHub Actions** uses `.github/workflows/*.yml` files
✅ **Codemagic** provides Flutter-first CI/CD with minimal setup
✅ **Quality gates** enforce code standards before merging
✅ Run tests automatically on every **pull request**
✅ **Cache dependencies** to speed up builds (10 min → 2 min)
✅ Deploy to stores automatically with **one click or on every tag**
✅ Monitor builds with **Slack/email notifications**
✅ Use **branch protection** to block PRs until checks pass

**Key Takeaway:** CI/CD transforms development from manual, error-prone processes to automated, reliable pipelines. Set it up once, and every code change is automatically tested and validated. This lets you deploy confidently multiple times per day instead of dreading monthly releases.
