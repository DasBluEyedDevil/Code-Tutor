### What are Quality Gates?

**Quality gates** are checks that must pass before code is merged or deployed.

### Essential Quality Gates

1. **Linting** - Code must follow style guidelines
2. **Unit Tests** - All tests must pass
3. **Widget Tests** - UI tests must pass
4. **Coverage** - Minimum coverage threshold
5. **Integration Tests** - Critical flows work
6. **Build Success** - App must build without errors

### Implementing Quality Gates


### Branch Protection Rules

Enforce quality gates in GitHub:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Branches**
2. Add rule for `main` branch
3. Enable:
   - ☑️ Require a pull request before merging
   - ☑️ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ☑️ Require branches to be up to date before merging
4. Select required checks:
   - ✅ Analyze code
   - ✅ Run tests
   - ✅ Check coverage

Now PRs can't be merged until all checks pass!
