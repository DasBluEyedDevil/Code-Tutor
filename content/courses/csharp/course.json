It checks a condition (Is it raining?) and makes a decision:\n\n• If the condition is TRUE → Do this code\n• If the condition is FALSE → Skip that code\n\nIn C#, we use 'if' to make our programs smart.

They don't check if you're hungry BEFORE asking - they ask FIRST, then check if you want more.\n\nThat's a DO-WHILE loop! It's like a while loop, but the condition is checked at the END, not the beginning. This guarantees the code runs AT LEAST ONCE!\n\nThink of it like trying a food sample at the grocery store:\n• Regular while: 'While you're hungry, take a sample' → If you're not hungry, you take ZERO samples\n• Do-while: 'Take a sample. Still hungry? Take another!' → You ALWAYS get at least one sample\n\nDo-while is perfect for menus, user input prompts, or anything where you need to do something at least once before checking a condition."

PARALLEL VS SEQUENTIAL:\n   - Sequential: await each task one by one\n   - Parallel: Start all, then Task.WhenAll\n\n6. CPU vs I/O:\n   - I/O bound: Use async/await (file, network, database)\n   - CPU bound: Use Task.Run for background processing\n\nThink: Async is like driving a car - you need to know not just HOW, but WHEN and WHERE to use each technique!"

In app code (UI/ASP.NET), usually not needed. Advanced topic!\n\n**`IProgress<T>`**: Interface for reporting progress. Create with 'new Progress<T>(callback)'. Call 'progress.Report(value)' in async method. Useful for long operations with UI updates.\n\n**`Async error handling`**: Use try/catch around await! Exceptions from awaited tasks propagate normally.
