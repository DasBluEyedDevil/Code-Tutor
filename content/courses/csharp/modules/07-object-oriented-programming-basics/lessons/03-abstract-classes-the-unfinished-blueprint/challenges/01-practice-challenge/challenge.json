DERIVED 'HourlyEmployee':\n   - Properties: decimal HourlyRate, int HoursWorked\n   - Override CalculateSalary(): return HourlyRate * HoursWorked\n\n3. DERIVED 'SalariedEmployee':\n   - Property: decimal AnnualSalary\n   - Override CalculateSalary(): return AnnualSalary / 12 (monthly)\n\n4. Create both types, call Display()",
