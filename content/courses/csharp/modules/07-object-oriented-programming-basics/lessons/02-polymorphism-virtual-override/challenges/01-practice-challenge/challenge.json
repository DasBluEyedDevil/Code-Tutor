BASE CLASS 'Shape':\n   - virtual method CalculateArea() returns double, returns 0\n   - virtual method Display() prints shape info\n\n2. DERIVED 'Circle' : Shape\n   - Property: double Radius\n   - Override CalculateArea(): return Math.PI * Radius * Radius\n   - Override Display(): print 'Circle with radius [r]'\n\n3. DERIVED 'Rectangle' : Shape\n   - Properties: double Width, double Height\n   - Override CalculateArea(): return Width * Height\n   - Override Display(): print 'Rectangle [w]x[h]'\n\n4. Create array of Shape, store Circle and Rectangle, call methods polymorphically",
