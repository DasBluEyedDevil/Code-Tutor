You've learned about 'string' variables (boxes for text). Now let's learn about boxes for NUMBERS!

In C#, there are different types of number boxes:

• int (integer): A box for WHOLE NUMBERS only (like 5, 100, -42). No decimals allowed!
• double: A box for DECIMAL NUMBERS (like 3.14, 99.99, -0.5). Can also hold whole numbers, but takes more space.

Why have different boxes? Efficiency! If you only need whole numbers (like counting players in a game), use 'int'. If you need decimals (like storing money or measurements), use 'double'.

Think of it like this: You wouldn't use a giant shipping container to store a pencil! Use the right box for the job.
