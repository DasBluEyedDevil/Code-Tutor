Sometimes you need to store a YES or NO answer. Is the player alive? Is the door locked? Is the game over?

That's where BOOLEAN variables come in! A boolean (named after mathematician George Boole) can only hold two values:

• true (yes, on, correct)
• false (no, off, incorrect)

Think of a boolean like a light switch – it's either ON or OFF, nothing in between!

In C#, we use the 'bool' type for these. Booleans are INCREDIBLY powerful for making decisions in programs (you'll see this soon when we learn 'if statements').
