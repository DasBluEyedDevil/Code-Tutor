## Breaking Down the Syntax

**`bool isPlayerAlive = true;`**: 'bool' is the type for true/false values. Notice: NO QUOTES around true! `true` and `false` are special keywords in C#.

**`true and false`**: These are NOT strings! Don't write `"true"` - just write `true`. They're built-in values that C# understands.

**`Variable naming`**: Boolean variables often start with 'is', 'has', 'can', or 'should' (like isReady, hasPermission, canJump, shouldRetry) because they answer yes/no questions.

**`bool isPassing = score >= 60;`**: Comparisons produce boolean results! This checks if score is greater than or equal to 60, and stores the result (true or false) in isPassing.
