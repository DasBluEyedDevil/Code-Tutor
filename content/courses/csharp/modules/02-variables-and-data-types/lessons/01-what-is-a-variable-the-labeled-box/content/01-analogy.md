Imagine you have empty boxes in a warehouse, and you need to store things in them. Each box gets a LABEL (like 'Books' or 'Toys') so you know what's inside.

Variables are exactly like labeled boxes! They're containers that store information in your program:

• The LABEL is the variable name (like 'playerScore' or 'userName')
• The CONTENTS are the value stored inside (like 100 or 'Alex')
• You can look inside the box anytime by using its label
• You can replace what's inside by putting new stuff in!

In C#, before you can use a box, you must tell the computer: "I need a box for storing text" or "I need a box for storing numbers." This is called DECLARING a variable.
