## Key Takeaways

- **Modulus (`%`) finds remainders** -- `10 % 3` equals `1`. Use `n % 2 == 0` to check if a number is even. This operator is essential for cycling through values and detecting patterns.

- **Parentheses override default precedence** -- multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction. Use `()` to make your intended order explicit: `(5 + 3) * 2` equals `16`, not `11`.

- **String interpolation with `$` embeds expressions** -- `$"Sum: {a + b}"` evaluates the expression inside the braces and inserts the result into the string.
