C# is like a super-powered calculator! You can do math with variables using familiar operators:

• + (addition): 5 + 3 = 8
• - (subtraction): 10 - 4 = 6
• * (multiplication): 6 * 7 = 42 (we use * because × isn't on keyboards!)
• / (division): 20 / 4 = 5
• % (modulus - remainder): 10 % 3 = 1 (10 divided by 3 is 3 remainder 1)

The modulus (%) might seem weird, but it's super useful! Want to know if a number is even? If number % 2 equals 0, it's even!

C# follows the same order of operations you learned in school: PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction).
