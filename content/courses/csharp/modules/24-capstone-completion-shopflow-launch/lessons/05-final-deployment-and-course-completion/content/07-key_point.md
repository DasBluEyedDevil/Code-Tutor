## Key Takeaways

- **Deploy with confidence using your CI/CD pipeline** -- the GitHub Actions workflow from Module 23 handles building, testing, and deploying ShopFlow. Manual deployments should never be necessary.

- **Monitor after deployment** -- use the Aspire dashboard (M16) and Azure Application Insights for production observability. Watch error rates, response times, and resource utilization in the first 24 hours.

- **You built a complete application** -- from `Console.WriteLine` to a production-deployed e-commerce platform with authentication, authorization, caching, testing, CI/CD, and observability. Every module contributed to this result.
