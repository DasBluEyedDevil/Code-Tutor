## Key Takeaways

- **Red: Write a failing test first** -- the test describes the behavior you want. It must fail before you write any implementation code. If it passes immediately, the test is wrong.

- **Green: Write the minimum code to pass** -- resist the urge to gold-plate. Get the test passing with the simplest possible implementation. Correctness first, elegance later.

- **Refactor: Improve with confidence** -- with passing tests as your safety net, clean up duplication, improve naming, and simplify logic. If tests still pass after refactoring, you have not broken anything.
