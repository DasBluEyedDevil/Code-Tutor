You've learned that Console.WriteLine displays text. But what if you want to display LOTS of information? You have two options:

1. Use multiple Console.WriteLine statements (you've been doing this!)
2. Use special characters like \n (newline) to create line breaks inside one statement

Think of \n as pressing the 'Enter' key on your keyboard. It tells the computer: "Start a new line here!"
