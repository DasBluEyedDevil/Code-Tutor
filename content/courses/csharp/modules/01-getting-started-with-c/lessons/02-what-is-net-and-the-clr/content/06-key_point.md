## Key Takeaways

- **The CLR handles the hard work** -- garbage collection (memory), JIT compilation (speed), and type safety (correctness) all happen automatically so you can focus on logic.

- **.NET 9 is the current version** -- released November 2024, it includes performance improvements, Native AOT for faster startups, and enhanced cloud-native features. Always target the latest LTS or current release.

- **One language, many platforms** -- C# code compiled for .NET runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux without changes. The CLR adapts your code to each operating system.
