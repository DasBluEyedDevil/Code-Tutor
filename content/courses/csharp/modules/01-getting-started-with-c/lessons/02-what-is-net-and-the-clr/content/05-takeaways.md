- **.NET** is the platform (tools, libraries, runtime) for building applications.
- **CLR (Common Language Runtime)** is the engine that executes your C# code.
- **IL (Intermediate Language)** is the universal code generated by the C# compiler.
- **JIT (Just-In-Time)** compilation converts IL to native machine code at runtime.
- **Garbage Collection (GC)** automatically manages memory so you don't have to.
- **Cross-Platform**: Modern .NET runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
