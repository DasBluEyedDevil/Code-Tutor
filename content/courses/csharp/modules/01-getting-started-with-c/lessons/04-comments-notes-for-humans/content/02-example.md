This example demonstrates all three types of comments in C#: single-line, multi-line, and XML documentation comments.

```csharp
// This is a single-line comment
Console.WriteLine("This runs!"); // Comments can go at the end of a line too!

/* This is a multi-line comment.
   You can write as much as you want.
   The computer will ignore ALL of this! */

Console.WriteLine("This also runs!");

// You can also "comment out" code to disable it:
// Console.WriteLine("This won't run!");

// Tip: In Visual Studio / VS Code:
// Select lines and press Ctrl+K, Ctrl+C to comment
// Press Ctrl+K, Ctrl+U to uncomment
```
