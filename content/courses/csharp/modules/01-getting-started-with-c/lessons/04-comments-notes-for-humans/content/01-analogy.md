Imagine you're leaving notes in a cookbook: "This recipe is spicy!" or "Mom's favorite!". These notes help YOU, but they don't change the recipe itself.

Comments in C# work the same way! They're notes for humans (including your future self) that the computer completely ignores. There are two types:

1. Single-line comments: // Everything after these slashes is ignored
2. Multi-line comments: /* Everything between these is ignored */

Good programmers use comments to explain WHY they wrote code, not just WHAT the code does. Future you will thank present you!
