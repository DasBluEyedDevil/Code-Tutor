## Real-World C# Applications

C# powers some of the world's most demanding systems, and learning it opens doors to diverse career opportunities.

**E-Commerce & Web Applications**
Major online retailers and platforms use ASP.NET Core for their backend APIs, handling millions of transactions daily. Stack Overflow, the world's largest programming Q&A site, runs entirely on .NET. Companies like GoDaddy, UPS, and Chipotle rely on C# for their web infrastructure. The performance optimizations in .NET 9 make it ideal for high-throughput e-commerce systems where every millisecond matters.

**Game Development**
Unity, the world's most popular game engine powering over 50% of all mobile games, uses C# as its primary scripting language. From indie hits like Hollow Knight and Cuphead to AAA titles, C# provides the perfect balance of performance and developer productivity. The language's strong typing catches bugs at compile time, crucial when building complex game logic.

**Enterprise & Financial Systems**
Banks, healthcare systems, insurance companies, and government agencies rely on C# for mission-critical applications. The language's emphasis on type safety, combined with .NET's robust security features, makes it the go-to choice for applications where reliability and compliance are non-negotiable. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and numerous healthcare providers run core systems on .NET.

**Cloud & Microservices**
Microsoft Azure's own services are built with .NET, and Azure provides first-class support for deploying C# applications. The modern .NET stack excels at containerized microservices, with minimal memory footprint and fast startup times. Companies increasingly choose C# for cloud-native development because of its performance characteristics and mature tooling ecosystem.

**In this course**, you'll build ShopFlow—a complete e-commerce platform—using the same technologies and patterns used by professional developers at these companies worldwide. By the end, you'll have a portfolio-ready project demonstrating full-stack .NET expertise.
