Imagine you're teaching a robot to make a sandwich. You can't just say "make me lunch" – the robot needs EXACT steps: pick up bread, put on peanut butter, put on jelly, combine slices. That's programming! You're giving a computer step-by-step instructions in a language it understands.

C# (pronounced "See-Sharp") is one of those languages. It's like English, but much more precise and rule-based. When you write C# code, you're telling the computer exactly what to do, one instruction at a time.
