## Key Takeaways

- **`Console.WriteLine()` is your first tool** -- it displays text on screen. Everything inside the parentheses and quotes is the message. Always end statements with a semicolon (`;`).

- **Top-level statements let you skip boilerplate** -- in .NET 6+, you write code directly in your file without wrapping it in a class or Main method. The compiler generates the structure for you.

- **Programming is giving precise instructions** -- computers execute exactly what you write, nothing more. If your output looks wrong, re-read your code character by character.
