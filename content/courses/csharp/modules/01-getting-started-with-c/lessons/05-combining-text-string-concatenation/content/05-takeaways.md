- **String Interpolation** is the modern, preferred way to combine text and data.
- It starts with a **`$`** before the opening quote.
- Variables go inside **curly braces `{}`**.
- You can perform math or logic inside the braces: `{x + 1}`.
- **Concatenation (`+`)** is the older method; it works but is harder to read and maintain.
