Imagine you have a form letter: "Dear [Name], Thank you for your order of [Number] items." To send it, you just fill in the blanks.

In C#, **String Interpolation** works exactly like that! It lets you insert variables directly into a text string.

Instead of gluing pieces of text together with `+` (which is messy and error-prone), you use a special `$` symbol to tell C#: "Hey, I'm going to put some variables inside this text!"
