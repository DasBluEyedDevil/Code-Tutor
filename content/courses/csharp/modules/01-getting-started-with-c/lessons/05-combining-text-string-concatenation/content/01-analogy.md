Sometimes you want to combine pieces of text, like combining 'Hello' and 'World' into 'Hello World'. This is called STRING CONCATENATION (fancy word for 'gluing text together').

In C#, you can combine text using the + operator:

"Hello" + " " + "World" becomes "Hello World"

You can also mix text and numbers! C# automatically converts numbers to text when you use +.

Think of + as glue – it sticks pieces of text together into one long piece!
