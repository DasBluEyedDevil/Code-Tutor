Imagine a real dictionary: You look up a WORD (the key) and get its DEFINITION (the value). You don't flip through page by page - you jump straight to the word!

A Dictionary<TKey, TValue> works the same way! It stores KEY-VALUE PAIRS:
• The KEY is unique (like a word - only appears once)
• The VALUE is what you get when you look up that key
• Lookup is INSTANT - no matter how big the dictionary!

Examples:
• Phone book: Name (key) → Phone number (value)
• Game: PlayerName (key) → Score (value)
• Store: ProductID (key) → Price (value)

Why not use a List? Lists require you to search through items one by one. Dictionaries use the key for INSTANT lookup - like using an index in a book!

Perfect for when you need to find things by a unique identifier!
