Create an instance using object initializer with ^ operator:\n   - Set [^1] = 1 (last position)\n   - Set [^2] = 2 (second-to-last)\n   - Set [^3] = 3 (third-to-last)\n   - Set [^4] = 4\n   - Set [^5] = 5 (first position)\n3. Display all numbers using a foreach loop\n4. Also display using ^1 index: 'Last number is: X'\n\nThe result should show: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1",
