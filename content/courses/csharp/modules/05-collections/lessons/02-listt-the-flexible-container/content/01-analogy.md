Remember arrays? They're like a bookshelf with fixed slots - you can't add more books if it's full!

A LIST is like a magical expanding shelf! You can:
• Add items anytime (shelf grows automatically!)
• Remove items (shelf shrinks!)
• Insert items in the middle
• Check if an item exists

Lists are DYNAMIC - they change size as needed. The <T> syntax (like List<int>) means 'List of what type?' Just like arrays, all items must be the same type, but unlike arrays, you can grow and shrink them!

Think of a grocery list app: You add items ('milk'), remove items when bought, and the list grows/shrinks automatically. You wouldn't use a fixed array for that - you'd use a List!

Lists are THE most common collection in C#. When in doubt, use a List!
