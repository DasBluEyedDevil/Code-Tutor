## Why .NET Aspire?

**Before Aspire:** docker-compose.yml + manual networking + multiple terminals + no visibility = pain

**With Aspire:** One C# project + automatic service discovery + beautiful dashboard + built-in telemetry = joy

**Dashboard features:**
- Real-time logs from all services
- Distributed traces (see request flow!)
- Metrics and health status
- GenAI Visualizer for LLM calls (Aspire 9.5+)

**When to use:** Any app with 2+ services, databases, or caches. Aspire makes local development feel like production.
