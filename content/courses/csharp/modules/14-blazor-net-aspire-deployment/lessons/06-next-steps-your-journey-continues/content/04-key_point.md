## Key Takeaways

- **Build projects, not just tutorials** -- the fastest path to proficiency is building real applications. Start small, iterate, and publish your work on GitHub as a portfolio.

- **Stay current with annual releases** -- C# and .NET release yearly (November). Follow the .NET Blog and What's New documentation to learn new features as they ship.

- **Join the community** -- Stack Overflow, the .NET Discord, and local meetups accelerate learning. Teaching others solidifies your own understanding.
