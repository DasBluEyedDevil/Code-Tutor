Deployment = Making your app available on the internet!

Local development (localhost):
• Only YOU can access
• Runs on your computer
• Lost when computer off

Production (Azure):
• EVERYONE can access
• Runs in Microsoft data center
• Always available (99.9% uptime!)

Azure services for .NET:
• Azure App Service - Host web apps/APIs
• Azure SQL Database - Cloud database
• Azure Blob Storage - File storage
• Azure Key Vault - Secrets management

Think: Azure = 'Microsoft's cloud platform. Professional hosting for your apps!'
