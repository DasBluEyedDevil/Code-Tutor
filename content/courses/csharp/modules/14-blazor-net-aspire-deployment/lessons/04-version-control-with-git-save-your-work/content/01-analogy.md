Git is like a time machine for your code:

Without Git:
• MyProject_v1.zip
• MyProject_v2_FINAL.zip
• MyProject_v2_FINAL_ACTUALLY_FINAL.zip
• Mess!

With Git:
• Track every change
• Go back to any version
• Work on features in branches
• Collaborate with team
• Never lose work!

Key concepts:
• COMMIT: Save snapshot of code
• BRANCH: Work on features separately
• PUSH: Upload to GitHub/Azure
• PULL: Download from GitHub/Azure

Think: Git = 'Professional version control. Every project needs it!'
