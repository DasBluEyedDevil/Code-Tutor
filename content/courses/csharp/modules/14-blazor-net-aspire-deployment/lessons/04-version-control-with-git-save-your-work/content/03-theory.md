## Breaking Down the Syntax

**`git add / git commit`**: 'git add' stages files. 'git commit' saves snapshot. Commit message describes change. Use present tense: 'Add feature' not 'Added feature'.

**`git branch / git checkout`**: Branches = separate timelines. Work on feature without affecting main. Checkout switches branches. Merge brings changes together.

**`git push / git pull`**: Push uploads commits to GitHub. Pull downloads from GitHub. Sync with team! Push often to back up work.

**`.gitignore`**: File listing what to ignore. Add: bin/, obj/, *.user, .vs/. Don't commit build outputs or secrets!
