Think of organizing a music library:

GROUPBY = Organizing by artist:
• Take all songs → Group by artist → Get { Artist: [songs] }
• Like creating folders: Beatles/, Bowie/, Queen/
• Each group has a KEY (artist name) and VALUES (songs)

SELECTMANY = Flattening nested playlists:
• You have: [ [Song1, Song2], [Song3], [Song4, Song5] ]
• SelectMany → [Song1, Song2, Song3, Song4, Song5]
• Turns nested collections into ONE flat list!

JOIN = Matching data from two sources:
• Like a VLOOKUP in Excel
• 'Match Orders with Customers on CustomerId'
• Combines data where keys match

These are ESSENTIAL for real-world data manipulation!

Think: 'GroupBy organizes, SelectMany flattens, Join connects!'
