Create a List with 5+ products\n\n3. Use .Select() to create:\n   - List of just product names\n   - List of prices with 10% discount applied\n   - List of anonymous objects with:\n     - Name\n     - Category\n     - TotalValue (Price * Stock)\n     - InStock (Stock > 0)\n\n4. Use .Where().Select() to get names of products under $100\n\n5. Display all results",
