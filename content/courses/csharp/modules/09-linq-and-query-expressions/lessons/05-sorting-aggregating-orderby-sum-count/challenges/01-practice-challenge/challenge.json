Create a List with 8+ students across 2-3 subjects\n\n3. Perform these operations:\n   - Sort students by grade (descending)\n   - Count how many students there are\n   - Calculate average grade\n   - Find highest and lowest grades\n   - Get sum of all grades\n   - Find students in \"Math\" subject, sorted by name\n   - Calculate average grade for \"Math\" students only\n\n4. Display all results with labels",
