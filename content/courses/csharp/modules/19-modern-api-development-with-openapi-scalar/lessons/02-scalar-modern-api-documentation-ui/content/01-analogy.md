Think of API documentation UIs like restaurant review apps:

OLD SWAGGER UI:
- Like an old restaurant website from 2010
- Works, but looks dated
- Basic features only
- Same design for every restaurant

SCALAR UI:
- Like a modern food delivery app
- Beautiful, intuitive design
- Dark mode, customizable themes
- Interactive examples and testing
- Makes you WANT to explore the menu!

WHY SCALAR OVER SWAGGER?

SWAGGER UI (Traditional):
- Industry standard for years
- Functional but aging design
- Limited customization
- Heavy JavaScript bundle

SCALAR (Modern Alternative):
- Clean, modern aesthetic
- Built-in dark mode
- Better code examples (multiple languages)
- Request/response side by side
- Faster loading
- Actively maintained

USER EXPERIENCE:
- Developers ENJOY using Scalar
- Better first impression of your API
- Interactive testing built-in
- Copy-paste ready code snippets

INTEGRATION:
- Works with any OpenAPI spec
- Drop-in replacement for Swagger
- Single NuGet package
- One line to add: app.MapScalarApiReference()

Think: 'Scalar is the modern, beautiful face of your API - making documentation a pleasure, not a chore!'
