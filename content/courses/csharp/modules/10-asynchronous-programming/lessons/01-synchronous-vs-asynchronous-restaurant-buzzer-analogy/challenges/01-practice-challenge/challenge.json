Create async method 'BrewCoffeeAsync(string type)':\n   - Print 'Brewing [type] coffee...'\n   - await Task.Delay(2000) to simulate brewing\n   - Print '[type] coffee ready!'\n   - Return Task\n\n2. Create async method 'ToastBreadAsync()':\n   - Print 'Toasting bread...'\n   - await Task.Delay(1000)\n   - Print 'Toast ready!'\n   - Return Task\n\n3. In Main (or top-level):\n   - Start brewing coffee (don't await yet!)\n   - Start toasting bread (don't await yet!)\n   - Print 'Doing other tasks...'\n   - await BOTH tasks\n   - Print 'Breakfast ready!'\n\nBoth should run SIMULTANEOUSLY!",
