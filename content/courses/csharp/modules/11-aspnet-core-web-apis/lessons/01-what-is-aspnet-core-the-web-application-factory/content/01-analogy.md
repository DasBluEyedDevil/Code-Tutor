Imagine a restaurant:
• KITCHEN prepares food (your business logic)
• WAITERS take orders and deliver food (HTTP handles requests/responses)
• MENU lists what's available (your API endpoints)
• CUSTOMERS make requests (web browsers, mobile apps, other services)

That's ASP.NET Core! It's a framework for building WEB APPLICATIONS and APIS:

WEB API = Application Programming Interface for the web
• Not a visual website (no HTML/CSS)
• Returns DATA (JSON, XML)
• Other apps consume your API (mobile apps, frontend frameworks, other services)

ASP.NET Core 9 features:
• MINIMAL APIs - Simple, lightweight endpoint definitions (93% less memory allocation!)
• FAST - One of the fastest web frameworks (benchmarked!)
• CROSS-PLATFORM - Runs on Windows, Linux, Mac
• BUILT-IN features: Logging, DI, Configuration, OpenAPI
• TypedResults - Strongly-typed responses with automatic OpenAPI metadata
• Native AOT - Compile to native code for instant startup

Think: ASP.NET Core = 'The factory that creates web services that speak HTTP and return data!'
