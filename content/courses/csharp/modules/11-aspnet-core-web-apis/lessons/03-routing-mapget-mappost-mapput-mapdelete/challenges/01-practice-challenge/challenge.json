Create in-memory list with 2 initial tasks\n\n3. Implement ALL CRUD operations:\n   - GET /api/tasks - Return all tasks\n   - GET /api/tasks/{id} - Return single task\n   - POST /api/tasks - Create new task (auto-assign ID)\n   - PUT /api/tasks/{id} - Update task\n   - DELETE /api/tasks/{id} - Delete task\n\n4. For POST: use nextId counter for auto-incrementing IDs\n\n5. Print available endpoints when API starts",
