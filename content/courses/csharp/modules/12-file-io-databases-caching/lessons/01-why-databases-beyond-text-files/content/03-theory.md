## Breaking Down the Syntax

**`Text file problems`**: Text files: slow search (read everything), no transactions (corruption risk), no relationships, no concurrency. Fine for config, terrible for data!

**`Database advantages`**: Databases: indexed (fast!), transactional (safe!), relational (connected data!), concurrent (multi-user!), scalable (millions of rows!).

**`SQL vs NoSQL`**: SQL (relational): tables, rows, columns, relationships. NoSQL (document/key-value): flexible schema. We'll learn SQL (most common for business apps).

**`Database types`**: SQL Server (enterprise), PostgreSQL (open-source powerhouse), MySQL (popular web), SQLite (embedded, no server). Each has strengths!
