Create sample LINQ queries and show what SQL they would generate:\n\n   Query 1: Find all books by \\\"Orwell\\\"\n   - C# LINQ: books.Where(b => b.Author == \\\"Orwell\\\")\n   - Print equivalent SQL\n\n   Query 2: Find books over $20, sorted by price\n   - C# LINQ: books.Where(b => b.Price > 20).OrderBy(b => b.Price)\n   - Print equivalent SQL\n\n   Query 3: Get titles of books from 2020+\n   - C# LINQ: books.Where(b => b.Year >= 2020).Select(b => b.Title)\n   - Print equivalent SQL\n\n3. Show benefits of ORM:\n   - Print why type safety matters\n   - Print why LINQ is better than SQL strings\n   - Print relationship navigation benefit",
