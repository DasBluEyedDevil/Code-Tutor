## Key Takeaways

- **else-if chains are checked top to bottom** -- once a condition is true, its block executes and all remaining conditions are skipped. Order your conditions from most specific to least specific.

- **Use guard clauses to reduce nesting** -- instead of deeply nested if-else, return early for invalid cases: `if (user is null) return;`. The remaining code handles the valid path without indentation.

- **The final `else` is your safety net** -- it catches everything not matched above. Include it when you need to handle "none of the above" cases, like a default error message.
