You've learned about 'if' - taking ONE path if a condition is true. But what if you want to do something DIFFERENT when the condition is false?

That's where 'else' comes in! Think of it like this:

'If it's sunny, wear sunglasses. ELSE (otherwise), wear a hat.'

You're guaranteed to do ONE of these two things - either the first or the second, never both!

But what if you have MORE than two options? That's where 'else if' helps:

'If it's sunny, wear sunglasses. ELSE IF it's raining, take an umbrella. ELSE (for anything else), wear a hat.'

C# checks each condition in order, top to bottom, and executes the FIRST one that's true. Once it finds a match, it STOPS checking the rest!
