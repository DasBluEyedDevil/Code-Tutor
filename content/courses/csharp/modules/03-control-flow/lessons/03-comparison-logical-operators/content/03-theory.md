## Breaking Down the Syntax

**`==`**: Double equals checks EQUALITY. Don't confuse with = (assignment)! age == 18 checks if age is 18. age = 18 SETS age to 18!

**`!=`**: Not equals checks INEQUALITY. score != 100 is true if score is anything OTHER than 100.

**`&&`**: AND requires BOTH sides to be true. age >= 21 && hasID is only true if BOTH conditions are true. If either is false, the whole thing is false!

**`||`**: OR requires AT LEAST ONE side to be true. isWeekend || isHoliday is true if EITHER (or both!) is true. Only false if BOTH are false.

**`!`**: NOT flips the value. !isRaining means 'if it is NOT raining'. If isRaining is false, !isRaining is true!
