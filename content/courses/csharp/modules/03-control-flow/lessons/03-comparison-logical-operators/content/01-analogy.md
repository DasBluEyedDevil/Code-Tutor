You've been using comparisons like >= and ==, but there's a whole toolkit available! These are called COMPARISON OPERATORS, and they let you ask questions about values:

• == (equals): Is this EXACTLY the same?
• != (not equals): Is this DIFFERENT?
• > (greater than): Is this BIGGER?
• < (less than): Is this SMALLER?
• >= (greater or equal): Is this bigger OR the same?
• <= (less or equal): Is this smaller OR the same?

But what if you need to check MULTIPLE conditions? Like: 'If it's Saturday AND I have money, I'll go to the movies.'

That's where LOGICAL OPERATORS come in:
• && (AND): BOTH conditions must be true
• || (OR): AT LEAST ONE condition must be true
• ! (NOT): Flips true to false, false to true

Think of && like a bouncer checking TWO IDs: 'You need to be 21 AND have a ticket.' You need BOTH!
