## Breaking Down the Syntax

**`if (condition)`**: The 'if' keyword starts the decision. The condition in parentheses MUST evaluate to true or false (a boolean).

**`{ }`**: Curly braces contain the code that runs ONLY if the condition is true. If false, everything in the braces is skipped!

**`age >= 21`**: This is a comparison that produces true or false. >= means 'greater than or equal to'. If age is 21 or more, it's true!

**`Code after if`**: Code outside the if block ALWAYS runs, whether the condition was true or false. The program continues normally.
