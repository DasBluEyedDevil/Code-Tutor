Create a record called 'AppInfo' with properties:\n   - Name (string)\n   - Version (string)\n   - StartTime (DateTime)\n\n2. In your main code:\n   - Create an AppInfo instance with your app's details\n   - Print the app name and version\n   - Calculate and print how long since the app started (use Stopwatch)\n   - Print whether the process is 64-bit\n   - Print the working set memory in MB\n\n3. Add comments indicating which parts are AOT-compatible\n\nFocus on AOT-safe patterns (no reflection, no dynamic code generation).",
