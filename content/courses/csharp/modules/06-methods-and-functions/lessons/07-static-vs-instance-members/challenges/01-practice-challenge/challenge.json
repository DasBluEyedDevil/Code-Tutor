Class 'Vehicle' with:\n   - STATIC field: int TotalVehicles = 0\n   - STATIC field: int MaxSpeed = 0\n   - INSTANCE fields: string Model, int Speed\n2. Constructor that increments TotalVehicles\n3. INSTANCE method Accelerate(int amount): increases Speed, updates static MaxSpeed if beaten\n4. STATIC method ShowStats(): displays TotalVehicles and MaxSpeed\n5. Create 3 vehicles, accelerate them, call ShowStats\n\nDemonstrate the difference between static (shared) and instance (individual)!",
