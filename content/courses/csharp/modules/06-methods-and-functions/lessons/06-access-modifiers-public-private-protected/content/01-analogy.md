Think of your house with different rooms:

• **PUBLIC** = Living room: Anyone can enter, guests welcome
• **PRIVATE** = Your bedroom: Only YOU can enter
• **PROTECTED** = Family room: Only family members (and you) allowed

Access modifiers control WHO can access your class members (fields, properties, methods).

Why restrict access? SECURITY and ORGANIZATION!
• Keep internal implementation private (users don't need to know HOW it works)
• Expose only what's necessary through public methods
• Prevent accidental modification of important data

This is **ENCAPSULATION** - one of OOP's core principles. Hide complexity, expose simplicity!
