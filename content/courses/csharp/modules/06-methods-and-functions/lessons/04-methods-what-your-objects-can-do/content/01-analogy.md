Imagine a TV remote. Each button makes the TV DO something: change channel, adjust volume, power on/off. You don't know HOW it works inside - you just press the button!

METHODS are like those buttons - they make objects DO things. Properties hold data (what the object IS), methods define behavior (what the object CAN DO).

Methods can:
• Take INPUT (parameters) - 'Add these two numbers'
• Produce OUTPUT (return value) - 'Here's the result: 7'
• Modify the object's state - 'Increase my score by 10'
• Just perform actions (void) - 'Print this message'

Think: A Calculator object has Add(), Subtract(), Multiply() methods. A Player object has TakeDamage(), Heal(), Attack() methods. Methods bring objects to LIFE!
