Imagine a pizza shop that accepts orders differently: 'I want pepperoni, mushrooms, olives' (listing items), or 'Here's my written list' (handing a paper), or 'Use my usual order' (referencing saved preferences). C# 13's enhanced params keyword works the same way - it accepts items inline, as collection expressions, or from existing collections!
