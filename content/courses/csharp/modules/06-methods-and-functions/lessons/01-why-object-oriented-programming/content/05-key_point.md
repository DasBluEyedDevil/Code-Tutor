## Key Takeaways

- **A class is a blueprint, an object is an instance** -- `class Player { }` defines the template. `new Player()` creates a concrete player with its own data. You can create many objects from one class.

- **Each object has independent data** -- `alice.Name` and `bob.Name` are separate. Changing one does not affect the other. This encapsulation is the foundation of OOP.

- **Use PascalCase for class names** -- `Player`, `GameBoard`, `ShoppingCart`. This C# convention distinguishes types from variables (which use camelCase).
