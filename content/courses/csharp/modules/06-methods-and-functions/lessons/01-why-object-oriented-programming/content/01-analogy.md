Imagine building 100 houses. Would you redesign each house from scratch? NO! You'd create a BLUEPRINT and build all houses from that blueprint!

That's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)! Instead of writing scattered variables and functions, you create BLUEPRINTS (called CLASSES) that define how things work. Then you build actual OBJECTS from those blueprints.

Without OOP:
string player1Name = 'Alice';
int player1Score = 100;
int player1Health = 80;
string player2Name = 'Bob';
int player2Score = 150;
int player2Health = 60;
...(100 players = 300 variables!)

With OOP:
Create a Player blueprint once.
Player alice = new Player('Alice', 100, 80);
Player bob = new Player('Bob', 150, 60);

OOP makes code ORGANIZED, REUSABLE, and SCALABLE. It's how professional software is built!
