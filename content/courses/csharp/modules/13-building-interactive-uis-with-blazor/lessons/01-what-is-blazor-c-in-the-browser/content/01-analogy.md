Imagine building a website:

OLD WAY:
• HTML for structure
• CSS for styling
• JavaScript for interactivity
• C# on server (backend only)

BLAZOR WAY:
• HTML for structure
• CSS for styling
• C# for interactivity! (No JavaScript required!)
• C# everywhere - frontend AND backend!

Blazor = Write interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript!

Think of it like:
• React/Vue/Angular = JavaScript frameworks
• Blazor = C# framework (same power, different language!)

Blazor lets you:
✅ Use C# skills for web development
✅ Share code between client and server
✅ Build SPAs (Single Page Applications)
✅ Rich interactivity without JavaScript
✅ Component-based architecture

Two main hosting models:
1. Blazor Server - C# runs on server, UI updates over SignalR
2. Blazor WebAssembly - C# runs IN BROWSER via WebAssembly
3. Blazor Auto (.NET 8) - Best of both!

Think: Blazor = 'Build modern web apps with C#, not JavaScript!'
