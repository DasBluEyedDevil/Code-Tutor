Events are like doorbells:

User clicks button = Someone rings doorbell
Your C# method runs = You answer the door

Blazor events:
• @onclick - Button clicks, div clicks
• @onchange - Input value changes
• @oninput - Every keystroke
• @onsubmit - Form submission
• @onmouseover - Mouse hover

Event handling:
1. User interacts (click, type, hover)
2. Browser fires event
3. Blazor calls your C# method
4. Method updates state
5. UI re-renders automatically!

Think: Events = 'User does something → Your C# code responds!'
