Create examples showing when to use each mode:\n\n   STATIC SSR:\n   - Product catalog page\n   - Blog posts\n   - Why: Fast, SEO, no interactivity needed\n\n   INTERACTIVE SERVER:\n   - Admin dashboard\n   - Form with validation\n   - Why: Complex logic on server, small payload\n\n   INTERACTIVE WEBASSEMBLY:\n   - Image editor\n   - Game\n   - Why: Works offline, no server calls\n\n   INTERACTIVE AUTO:\n   - E-commerce site\n   - Social media feed\n   - Why: Fast start, then offline capability\n\n2. Print comparison table\n3. Show .NET 8 configuration code\n4. Explain trade-offs",
