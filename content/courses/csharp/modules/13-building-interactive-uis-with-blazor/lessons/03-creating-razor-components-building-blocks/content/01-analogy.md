Components are like LEGO blocks:

• Each block (component) is self-contained
• Blocks snap together to build complex structures
• Reuse the same block many times
• Each block has its own logic and appearance

Button.razor = reusable button component
Card.razor = reusable card component  
NavBar.razor = reusable navigation

Components have:
• MARKUP (HTML) - What it looks like
• LOGIC (@code) - How it behaves
• PARAMETERS - Customization options
• EVENTS - Communication with parents

Think: Component = 'Self-contained, reusable UI piece with its own HTML, CSS, and C# logic!'
