CUSTOM EXCEPTION 'InsufficientFundsException':\n   - Inherits from Exception\n   - Constructor accepts message\n\n2. CLASS 'BankAccount':\n   - Property: decimal Balance\n   - Method Withdraw(amount):\n     - If amount > Balance, throw InsufficientFundsException\n     - Otherwise, subtract amount\n\n3. In main code:\n   - Create account with balance $100\n   - Try to withdraw $150 (will throw exception)\n   - Catch InsufficientFundsException\n   - Finally: Display \"Transaction complete\"",
