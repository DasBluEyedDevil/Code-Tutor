Imagine you're driving a car. Most of the time everything works fine, but what if you get a flat tire? You need a PLAN: pull over safely, turn on hazards, call for help.

That's what EXCEPTIONS are in programming! They're unexpected problems that happen while your code runs:
• User enters text instead of a number
• File doesn't exist when you try to open it
• Network connection drops
• Division by zero

Without a plan, your program CRASHES! With try/catch, you handle the problem gracefully:
• TRY: 'Try to do this risky thing'
• CATCH: 'If something goes wrong, do this instead'

Think: try/catch = 'Attempt the task, but have a backup plan if it fails.' Your program stays running instead of crashing!
