Imagine building a house. You COULD make your own hammer, saw, and nails from scratch... or you could buy them from a hardware store! Much faster!

That's what SYSTEM LIBRARIES are - pre-built tools that come with .NET:
• System.Collections.Generic → List, Dictionary, Queue
• System.IO → Reading/writing files
• System.Linq → Querying data (next module!)
• System.Text → String manipulation, StringBuilder
• System.DateTime → Dates and times

These are BATTLE-TESTED, OPTIMIZED tools used by millions of developers. Don't reinvent the wheel!

Think: System libraries = 'The free toolbox that comes with C#.' Learning what's available saves HUNDREDS of hours of coding!
