  "instructions": "Work with JSON data using System.Text.Json!\n\n1. Create a 'Book' class:\n   - string Title\n   - string Author\n   - int Year\n   - decimal Price\n\n2. Create a List of 3 books\n\n3. Use JsonSerializer.Serialize() to convert list to JSON\n   - Use JsonSerializerOptions { WriteIndented = true } for readability\n   - Display the JSON\n\n4. Save JSON to a file (books.json)\n\n5. Read the file back and deserialize to List<Book>\n\n6. Display all book titles from the deserialized list\n\nNOTE: System.Text.Json is built into .NET - no NuGet install needed!",
