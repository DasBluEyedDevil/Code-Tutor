Imagine you want to add GPS navigation to your phone. You don't build it from scratch - you download an app from the App Store!

That's what NUGET is - the 'app store' for C# code libraries (called PACKAGES):
• Need to work with JSON? Use built-in System.Text.Json (or install Newtonsoft.Json)
• Need to send emails? Install MailKit
• Need to parse CSV files? Install CsvHelper
• Need to connect to databases? Install Entity Framework Core

These packages are built by other developers and SHARED for free (mostly). They're:
• TESTED by thousands of users
• MAINTAINED with bug fixes
• DOCUMENTED with examples
• VERSIONED (you can upgrade/downgrade)

Think: NuGet = 'Don't write everything yourself! Stand on the shoulders of giants.' Professional developers use dozens of NuGet packages!
