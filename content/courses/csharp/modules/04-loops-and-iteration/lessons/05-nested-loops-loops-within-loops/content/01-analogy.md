Imagine you're organizing a tournament where every team plays every other team:

• Outer loop: Go through each team (Team A, Team B, Team C...)
• Inner loop: For THIS team, play against every OTHER team

Team A plays Team B, Team C, Team D...
Team B plays Team A, Team C, Team D...
And so on!

That's a NESTED LOOP - a loop INSIDE another loop!

Think of it like checking every seat in a theater:
• Outer loop: Go through each ROW (Row 1, Row 2, Row 3...)
• Inner loop: For THIS row, check each SEAT (Seat A, B, C...)

Row 1, Seat A → Row 1, Seat B → ... → Row 2, Seat A → Row 2, Seat B...

Nested loops are powerful for grids, patterns, tables, or any time you need to do something for EVERY COMBINATION of two things!
