Imagine you need to write 'I will not talk in class' 100 times on the blackboard. You wouldn't write it once and think 'okay, done!' - you'd repeat it exactly 100 times.

That's what a FOR LOOP does! It repeats code a SPECIFIC number of times. You tell it:
1. Where to start (I'm starting at line 1)
2. When to stop (Keep going until I reach line 100)
3. How to count (Add 1 each time)

Think of it like a countdown: '10, 9, 8, 7...' or a count-up: '1, 2, 3, 4...'. The for loop handles the counting FOR you!

The for loop is PERFECT when you know EXACTLY how many times to repeat. Need to process 50 items? Use a for loop counting from 0 to 49. Need to print numbers 1 to 10? For loop!
