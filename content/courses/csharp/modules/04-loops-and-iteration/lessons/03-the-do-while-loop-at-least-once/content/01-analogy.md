Imagine a restaurant: 'Please tell me what you'd like to order.' They ask you at LEAST ONCE, even if you say 'I'm not hungry.' They don't check if you're hungry BEFORE asking - they ask FIRST, then check if you want more.

That's a DO-WHILE loop! It's like a while loop, but the condition is checked at the END, not the beginning. This guarantees the code runs AT LEAST ONCE!

Think of it like trying a food sample at the grocery store:
• Regular while: 'While you're hungry, take a sample' → If you're not hungry, you take ZERO samples
• Do-while: 'Take a sample. Still hungry? Take another!' → You ALWAYS get at least one sample

Do-while is perfect for menus, user input prompts, or anything where you need to do something at least once before checking a condition.
