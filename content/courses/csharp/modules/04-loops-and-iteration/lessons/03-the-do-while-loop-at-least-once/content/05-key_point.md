## Key Takeaways

- **`do-while` runs the body at least once** -- the condition is checked after the first execution. Use it when you need to perform an action before deciding whether to repeat.

- **Do not forget the semicolon after `while(condition);`** -- this is the most common do-while syntax error. The semicolon at the end is required, unlike a regular `while` loop.

- **Ideal for input validation and menus** -- prompt the user, validate, and re-prompt if invalid. The "ask at least once" pattern maps perfectly to do-while.
