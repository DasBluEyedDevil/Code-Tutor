Imagine you're reading through a book chapter by chapter:

• BREAK: You find the answer you need on chapter 5. You say 'I'm done!' and CLOSE THE BOOK completely. You exit the loop!

• CONTINUE: You're on chapter 3 and it's boring. You say 'Skip this chapter!' and jump to chapter 4. You stay in the loop, just skip THIS iteration!

These are CONTROL STATEMENTS that give you finer control over loops:

**break** = Exit the loop IMMEDIATELY, no matter what. Jump to the code after the loop.

**continue** = Skip the REST of this iteration and jump to the next one. The loop continues!

Think of a security checkpoint:
• break: 'Suspicious person found! Shut down the whole checkpoint!' (exit loop)
• continue: 'This person is fine, next person please!' (skip to next iteration)
