Imagine you're flipping a coin repeatedly until you get heads. How many flips will it take? You don't know! Could be 1, could be 10, could be 50.

That's when you use a WHILE loop! Unlike a for loop (which counts a specific number of times), a while loop says: 'WHILE this condition is true, keep repeating.'

Think of it like checking your phone: 'While I have unread messages, keep reading them.' You don't know how many messages there are - you just keep going WHILE there are more!

Or waiting in line: 'While the line is not empty, keep moving forward.' The line could be 3 people or 300 people - the while loop handles it!

While loops are PERFECT when you don't know how many times to repeat, but you know the CONDITION to stop.
